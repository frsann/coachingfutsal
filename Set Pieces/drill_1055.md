BASE MOVEMENT: T1: Pivot B moves up to the defensive line. A passes the ball to B. T2: B returns the ball to A, who has moved to meet it and delivers it for teammate C. SOLUTIONS: S1: C shoots at the goal between the 1st and 2nd man of the opponent's wall. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Pivot B must unmark above the defensive line to receive securely. C shoots between the wall, as the 2nd man of the wall is presumed to push out towards the ball. This solution is valid for both a shifted wall and a non-shifted one.
