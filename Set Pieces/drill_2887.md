"Shoot the inactive balls"

**Progression:**
Let's play a 3 vs 3 at half-field using 2 touches. Two players are placed in each corner for a corner kick, and one player stands at the back of the field outside. Every time the ball goes out, a corner will always be taken, and the player who is standing outside will enter to act as the defender on the goal line for the corner. This way, we will practice many set-pieces in a short time.

**Variations:**
If one of the players wants, they can also stand on the line and take a throw-in.
