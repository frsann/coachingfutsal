**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Successfully training set pieces in detail (in this case, corners) in conjunction with transitions (both negative and positive) is certainly a way to train the Game and, above all, the dynamics that often occur during a match.

**Progression:**
Indeed, it's easy for transitions to develop from a corner, or for there to be second balls to play for the attack. Therefore, it's mandatory for the coach to create contexts where players can experience and face the problems they would encounter in similar situations during a game. Didactically, players are divided into two teams of 4 players plus goalkeepers. One player per team has a ball in hand, and after the corner is taken—where there is a limited number of passes to reach a conclusion—depending on which team has possession once the ball goes out, the player belonging to that team will put the ball on the ground to execute a transition or a second ball situation. In this way, players experience transition dynamics or second balls that can be reviewed multiple times within the game, from triggering points and in very real moments for the players. The coach will take care to change plays and defenses to subsequently vary the resulting situations.
