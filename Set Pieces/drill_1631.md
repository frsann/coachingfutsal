SOLUTIONS: S1: A passes the ball to C, who turns and shoots at the goal. S2: A passes the ball to D, who turns and passes to B at the 2nd post or shoots at the goal. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Players D and C must quickly turn towards the goal. The aim is to exploit the element of surprise, as opponents expect the players to be in that position to disrupt the wall.
