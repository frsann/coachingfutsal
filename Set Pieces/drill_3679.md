**Progression:**
Didactically, the activity is divided and different in two halves of the field, but all players, according to the rotations, participate in both dynamics of the activity. In the left half of the field, there will be a touch and shot with a second post closure, often used for offensive throw-ins, but in the rotation, the one who has touched the ball from the throw-in will move to the other side to come forward and shoot from the throw-in, before rotating to close the post, with the other player in line restarting. In the other half of the field, the throw-in happens after the movement of the receiver who starts from the second post, circles to reach the height of the ball line, and shoots; the one who passes the ball will move strongly into the penalty area to receive a corner in the heart of the defense to deflect towards the goal, before rotating and taking the corner kick position. The one who has taken the corner will be the one to take the throw-in.
