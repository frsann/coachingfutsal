The player on the side closest to the goal gives the corner. The pivot is at the near post, and the other winger is at the far post. The base and goalkeeper are positioned as shown. On the referee's signal, movements happen simultaneously, and the corner-taker chooses the best option from the target areas. From the target area in front of the goal - finish with one touch. From the target area in front of the gate - finish with one touch, or pass back to the corner-taker who plays to a better position, or let the ball through to the target area of the back player. The back player's target area is also a direct option IF the opponent does not cover it.
