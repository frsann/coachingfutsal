**Materials:**


**Progression:**
BASE MOVEMENT:

T1: Wing players C and D position themselves at 8 meters and start moving in advance, compared to the corner kick. In this movement, they must try to make contact with the opponents, giving the false message of a block or crossover. When A is about to kick (following 2 steps back), the two players execute the final crossover movement. Player C starts closer to the goal and then moves to the center (around 12 meters) to offer a long solution.

SOLUTIONS:

S1: Player A passes the ball to teammate C, at the far post.

S2: Player A passes the ball to the near post for teammate D.

S3: Player A passes the ball to pivot B, who volleys it into the goal.

POINTS OF ATTENTION:

The philosophy is that the solution is found through the continuous movement of the players. The role of the player taking the corner is very important as they must decide the solution based on the movement of teammates and opponents.
