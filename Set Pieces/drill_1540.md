From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players divided into 2 teams, consisting of 4 outfield players and 1 goalkeeper per team.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to distinguish the teams.

**Progression:**
A standard 5-on-5 game is played, with mandatory man-to-man defense as long as the teams have an equal number of players. When the coach calls the name of a defender, that player must immediately leave the field and run to touch their own baseline. After touching the line, they return to defend with the rest of their teammates. The winner of the challenge is the team that scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
Introduce the touch limit. The defender goes to touch the opponent's goal line, which generates a transition to a longer situation.
