**Materials:**
4 balls, 4 different colors of bibs, to define the teams. Bring 2 goals to the half field.

**Progression:**
It starts with a 2 versus 2 towards the goal defended by P1. The two attackers, in a corner-kick situation, try to get free to aim for the net. Every two balls, the pairs switch roles: those who were attacking go to defend the other goal; those who were defending move to the corner kick; the person who set the ball in play goes to attack. At the end of the two plays, the pairs switch roles again and attack the opposite goal.
