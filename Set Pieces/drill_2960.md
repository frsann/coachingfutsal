**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 20x20 field. Every stoppage is a corner or a throw-in near the goal being attacked. The game is played with two touches except for three when the ball comes from the opponent or in the final goal-scoring action. Reward: every goal results in an additional stoppage. Penalty for poor team coordination: a 10-meter shot for the opponent. Emphasize concentration, initial positioning, and synchronization.

The goal only counts if it's scored directly.
