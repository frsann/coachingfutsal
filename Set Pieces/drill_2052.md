# Drill 2052

**Short description:**
Corner + 2v2 in 6 seconds.

**Objectives:**
Perfecting corner kick actions. Quick transition and finishing.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8-12

**Number of players:**
At least 4 + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We start the game with a corner. There is no defense. We are working on pre-agreed plays from the corner. After the shot on goal, the passer and the shooter become defenders, and the other two players become attackers. In the case shown in the image, 3 and 5 run into defense while 2 and 4 attack. The attackers have 6 seconds to complete the action. Organize the ball passer to the goalkeeper to speed up the action.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the playground. Change the time for the finale. The coach calls on the defenders.
