**Progression:**
BASE MOVEMENT: T1: B passes the ball to C, who runs and makes a strong kick to the far post to favor D's unmarking. SOLUTIONS: S1: C shoots hard to the far post, where D deflects it into the goal. S2: C quickly dribbles the ball along the line, and then plays it to the far post for D. S3: C, with the sole of the foot, passes the ball back to B, who passes the ball to D's positioning for support, and then returns the ball to player B, who finishes into the net. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Player D, if possible, should execute a slide closure to the far post, thus offering a larger contact surface. In solution S2, if C gets very close to the end line, the pivot D should unmark in the center of the area. TACTICAL SITUATION: The execution should not be too far from the goal: from 6 to 14 meters.
