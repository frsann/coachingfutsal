**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, marked jerseys, cones

**Progression:**
A real game on 28x20, 3v3 + 2 attacking Jokers per team (1 on each longitudinal side) + goalkeepers. Each of the four Jokers has a ball and can enter the game each time an attacker from their team controlledly exits with the ball on their side. Jokers must always be on the attacking half of the field, while players exiting can do so from any part of the field. We apply defensive guidelines: zonal defenses, coverage, space control based on perceptual patterns (game orientation, pressure on the ball, etc.). Pay special attention to zonal defensive rotations with the goal of repositioning the zonal defense each time the substitution of a Joker and a player causes defensive problems due to the breached first defensive line.

**Variations:**
Only first-touch goals count.

Positional Attack, Positional Defense - Pressing
