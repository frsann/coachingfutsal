**Progression:**
Three attackers are positioned at the center as shown in the picture. A defender waits 10m away. The game starts with the central attacker making two touches, with the requirement that the second touch must be a pass before the ball leaves the center circle (if this rule is not followed, the player goes into defense). Once the ball is set in motion with the first touch from the center, the two side attackers join in. After the central player passes to one side, the game continues with one-touch play. The attackers have 6 passes to complete the play. The defender counts the passes. If they forget to count, the attackers can make as many passes as they want. The player who concedes the most goals is obliged to perform a pre-arranged consequence (push-ups, sit-ups, etc.).

**Variations:**
Change the number of additions for the finish. Introduce time as a constraint.

**Categories:**
