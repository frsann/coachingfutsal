# Drill 3257

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The objective of this activity is the defensive work of the 1st and 2nd lines (team in a 3vs2 setup) or overall defensive work (team with 4 players).

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Asymmetry 3v4 where the team with 3 players has 2 supports on the sideline who can move and free themselves, and if they receive the ball, they can enter the field. Since the team playing in 3v2 is numerically superior, many necessary switching situations (zone defense) will be triggered, including defensive rotations and marking jumps. When the team with 4 players regains possession of the ball, they play 4v3, with the obligation that a pivot must gain depth and thus play 3v3+1. The team that is in the minority must press, working on the coordination of the first and second defensive line to prevent the ball from reaching the pivot, but if it does arrive, they must control after the attackers' supportive entries. With this exercise, we work on defensive organization either in a global perspective (4 players + GK) or group (1st and 2nd defensive line).

**Variations:**
You can limit the action of the side supports to work on the 1st line and jumps (the supports must be behind or on the ball line) or focus on the last defensive line and rapid reorganization in depth (the supports can only be in the last 10 meters of the field).
