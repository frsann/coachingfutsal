# Drill 453

**Short description:**
A 4x4 game is played on a 40x20 field with free touches, and each team has two jokers in the corners.

**Objectives:**
Pass to the pivot, finish.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
2 series of 6 minutes.

**Number of players:**
12 players + 2 goalkeepers (2 players from each team, stand in the corners).

**Materials:**
Goals, balls, bibs.

**Progression:**
The game is played 4 vs 4 on a 40 x 20 with free touches (each team has two wildcards in the corners). A goal can be scored without "connecting" with the pivot. If a player connects with one of the pivots with "one touch," the player making the pass must switch places and go to their teammate's position. If a player connects with one of the pivots with "two touches," the pivot has two touches to assist their teammate, who is obliged to finish.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches for the attackers. Reward with a DOUBLE GOAL, the goal scored by the "THIRD MAN" when playing with one of the pivots. Award a double goal (in back post actions).
