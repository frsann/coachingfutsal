**Progression:**
Organization: • 2 teams of 12 field players each. Both teams have a playing coach. • 5v5 games on a full-sized field. Rule applications adjusted according to the development needs of offensive play, for example: • Wing play: when opening and building the attack, there must be forwards on both wings (approximately in the wide third) • Mandatory switch of play after 2-3 passes • After a play stoppage, attacks must always be initiated from a 4-0 formation • Regional restrictions on touches

Key Points: Individual and group feedback to players from playing coaches during substitution periods, emphasizing the day's teaching themes • Fundamentals (individual technical-tactical foundational skills): • Application of basic technical skills: use of the sole, directed receives, using both feet • Playing stance and visual control of the field • Space management relative to the marking defender • Movement without the ball, variation of movements toward and away from the ball • Principles: • Support: Supporting the player with the ball to enable advancement. Practically moving without the ball to break away from marking, for example, by moving between defensive lines or using deceptive movements on the wing to create space for oneself • Security: Creating an easy passing lane for the player with the ball and ensuring attacks • Width: Maintaining field balance in width to enable the variation of the attack side and providing an additional option for the player with the ball • Progression: The primary option for the player with the ball is to progress, observing opportunities to advance • In defense, active team pressing
