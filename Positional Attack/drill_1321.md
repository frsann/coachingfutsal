# Drill 1321

**Short description:**
Real game on 20x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers. We divide the 20x20 space into 4 symmetrical squares of 10x10.

**Objectives:**
Work on improving the collective defensive aspects of Zone Defense, starting from reading the game based on perceptual patterns. Zonal marking in zones that each defender covers starting from the initial defensive formation of 1-2-2.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
8 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Didactic unit: Defensive collective tactics. Content: Zone defense. Guidelines for zone defense. Zone of defensive influence. Zone defense in a 1-2-2 system. Real game on 20x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers. We divide a 20x20 space into four 10x10 squares. The rule is that each defensive player must defend one of these spaces (10x10) and cannot intervene in the other three spaces unless the ball crosses half the field (10 meters), in which case defenders from offensive squares can retreat to defensive squares on their side. Thus, we work on zone defense in a 2-2 system, focusing on defending passing lines by intercepting passes, controlling space within each player's defensive zone of influence. Work on floating situations, "stealing" time, and closing passing lines in defense in inferiority within the zone of defensive influence.

**Variations:**
A goal only counts if it is scored from the first touch.

Positional Attack, Positional Defense
