# Drill 2060

**Short description:**
3v3 on 28x20, only individual defense.

**Objectives:**
Improving feints for progress in the endgame. Understanding the importance of timing the feint and body orientation to maintain control of the field of vision during the feint.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, branded t-shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
3v3 on 28x20. Mandatory individual defense. A realistic game through which we influence individual aspects of marking and the basics of defensive cooperation (help, covering, etc.). We can impose different positions of the first line when starting pressure on the ball, to work in individual defensive pressure situations, open defense, half-court defense, or closed defense. We will use 3-4 teams that we will change periodically.

**Variations:**
Goal from the first, limit the number of touches.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Positional Defense
