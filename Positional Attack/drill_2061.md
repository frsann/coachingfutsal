**Progression:**
A real game on a 20x20 field, 4v4 + Goalkeeper for both teams. Goals are only scored from the first touch within 6 meters. Attack only on one side where there are two goals. We work on attacking one side by targeting two goals located on the goal-line but inside the 6-meter area (see image). When the defending team wins the ball or the ball goes out of play as a result of good defensive play, the goalkeeper puts the ball back into play by passing it to the team that won the ball. At that moment, defense and attack roles switch. We explain the basics of perception for reading the game and controlling space and coverage, paying attention to the ball, the opposing players, the ball, the direct opponent, etc. Pressure on the ball when it arrives at the destination to avoid it approaching the defended goal. When the game orientation is on the opposite side from my position on the field, work on controlling space and coverage. Read situations to assist a teammate in 1v1 situations.

**Variations:**
Allow a goal by the other, weaker foot.
