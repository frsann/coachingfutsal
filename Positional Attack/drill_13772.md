**Progression:**
Didactically, a 5vs4 game is played towards a goal by illustrating and practicing all maneuvers, all ways in which the team expresses the advantage play with the goalkeeper. A goal is placed at the 25-meter mark with an active goalkeeper, even if the team to which he belongs plays with a flying goalkeeper, and another empty goal is kept at the end of the field. The game flows normally, and when the defense recovers the ball, it can choose to shoot towards the empty goal at the end of the field using a maximum of one pass; alternatively, they can play freely attacking the goal situated at the 25 meters mark. Naturally, the player with the goalkeeperâ€™s jersey does not participate in the defensive action. Since this is an activity to train power play, the 4vs4 game only flows when the ball is active (i.e., from a recovered ball or an active save by the goalkeeper), when instead the ball goes out in favor of the defense, an action restart is made for the team using the power play.
