# Drill 95

**Short description:**
3vs3 on the basketball court, a goal in the attack counts only after a play with the pivot, in a counterattack by any means.

**Objectives:**
Pivot attack, creating passing lanes, movement of the 1st and 2nd players, switching positions when attacking.

**Area (mxm):**
28x15 (basketball court)

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
12 (4 teams of three players each)

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, movable goals, cones

**Progression:**
The game is played on a basketball court with two goals. The attacking team always attacks with a pivot, and players can change positions. If the defensive players gain possession of the ball, a counterattack follows. In the attack, a goal is only valid if the pivot stops the ball with the sole and returns it to a teammate with the sole. In a counterattack, a goal is valid in all ways. We have 4 teams of 3 players each. Each scored goal awards a reward in the form of a shot from 10 meters. We can limit the attack time. Defensive players have 5 accumulated fouls, and each subsequent one results in a 10-meter shot. Insist on a 2v1 defense (doubling on the line).

**Variations:**
Limit the time of attack. Reduce the number of touches. Change the dimensions of the playing field.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Positional Defense
