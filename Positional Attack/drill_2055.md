# Drill 2055

**Short description:**
Let's divide 40x20 into three equal zones, approximately 13x20 each.

**Objectives:**
Zone defense. We are working on improving the collective defensive aspects of zone defense, enhancing the two-player defensive line, and gaining space against zone defense through a 3v2 numerical advantage.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15 min.

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
Divide 40x20 into three equal zones, approximately 13x20 each. The game is played with 4 attackers and 6 defenders plus goalkeepers. The 6 defenders are allocated in pairs in each zone without the possibility of entering other zones. The condition for attackers is that there can be a maximum of three players in the same zone. The goal is to perfect the defensive lines in zonal defense composed of two players against 3 attackers. Before each role change, two players from the former defensive team exit while two players from the former attacking team enter.

**Variations:**
Let's limit the number of touches of the attacker.

**Categories:**
