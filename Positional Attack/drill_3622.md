# Drill 3622

**Short description:**
The Futsal way

**Objectives:**
In this activity, great importance is given to developing a maneuver for a team that uses playing with a pivot because, by adjusting just one aspect, more freedom is given to the pivot to receive, and the attentional focus of the other 3 teammates (and respectively the defenders) is to find a way to pass to the pivot (or to prevent it).

**Area (mxm):**
32x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 3vs3 game is played on a reduced field with 1 pivot per team and 1 defender per team. The peculiarity is that an area (not physically marked) is designated where the pivot receives and frees themselves up; this area can be central, as in this case, or lateral, depending on our needs. The defender assigned to the pivot can enter the game and actively defend on the pivot only when the ball is received.

**Variations:**
The developments are manifold and all derived from the game, but the main objective is to research the best way to develop a three-player maneuver to find a connection with the pivot.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack - Exit Pressing, Positional Defense - Pressing, Real Game - Modified - Modeled
