**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
All players

Balls, markers

**Progression:**
The pivot (4) opens to the right after a fake move to the opposite side. The back (2) moves along the line before the goalkeeper plays to the pivot (4). Meanwhile, the rear (1) diagonally closes the left side and stops in the space between, offering a solution for the pivot who controls the ball - if the ball is returned to the rear (1), the back (2) runs towards the right corner. If the rear (1) does not play a long ball, the back quickly returns along the line and opens the possibility for a backdoor pass - if the rear (1) does not play a long ball to the back (2), he plays with the back (3) - 3 players in a line.

**Variations:**
- developing different possibilities - limiting the number of touches
