**Progression:**
The activity takes place on a 20x20 meter field with one goal, featuring 2 teams of 4 players each and only one goalkeeper. The game is a 3vs3 with 1 player from each team in the center circle. The team in possession can utilize this joker at midfield, who will take the place of the teammate from whom they receive the ball. The aim is to use the joker as many times as possible to exploit defensive imbalances or temporary numerical superiority. The joker can be exchanged multiple times during the same play. The defending team can attack only when they regain possession of the ball or execute an exit from pressing (with a goal kick or throw-in) and serve the joker at midfield. In this case, the player who made the pass will switch with the teammate at midfield. The skill of the two teams should therefore be to quickly transition from high pressing to low pressing for those in the defensive phase, and from an exit pressing phase to a quick attack phase for the other team.
