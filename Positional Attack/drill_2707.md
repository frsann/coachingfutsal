# Drill 2707

**Short description:**
The game is played 3v3 in the central zone 20x20 plus the back and pivot below the 10m line.

**Objectives:**
Improve ball circulation to create a pass opportunity to the pivot. Connect with the pivot through the collaboration of 2-3 players. Improve defense to prevent offensive progress.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on needs"

**Number of players:**
At least 10 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We play on the entire field which is divided into 3 zones: 2 outer zones of 10x20m and one central 20x20m zone. In the outer zones, the teams have a defender and a pivot, but the defender can only defend on the 10m line and can enter the zone only after the ball enters. Until then, they only work on anticipation. In the central zone, it is 3v3, and players must connect with the pivot in the outer zone. They can enter the final zone only when their pivot receives the ball. The pivot can also defend the attack, but always within the outer zone. Once they receive the ball, they play with two touches and can either finish or connect with one of the teammates who will be able to enter the final zone once the pivot receives the ball.

**Variations:**
A goal can be scored even from a shot taken from the central zone. The pivot can step in front of the defender for 2-3 seconds, and if the ball doesn't reach him, he must return behind the last defender and try to connect again.
