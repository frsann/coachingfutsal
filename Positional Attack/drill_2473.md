# Drill 2473

**Short description:**
Analytical warm-up reviewing offensive movements - Gargelli

**Objectives:**
Warm-up - getting familiar with game movements

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10

**Number of players:**
8 + nP

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Let's try the movements starting with a duality plus a pivot or with a trio plus a pivot. There won't be a goalkeeper, so we'll finish in a "light" way.

**Variations:**
Force the pair or trio to make a different solution than those who performed before them (forcing them to stay attentive and make a minimum choice). Place 2 goalkeepers in the goal who will obviously try in every way not to concede goals (finish in less than 6 seconds).
