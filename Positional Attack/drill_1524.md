**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Continue situations of equality and numerical disparity

**Area (mxm):**
20x28 meters

**Duration (min):**
From 10 to 20 minutes

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 4 forwards, and 4 defenders

**Materials:**
1 ball. Vests to define the teams. Cones: to mark the field.

**Progression:**
It starts with a 4 versus 4, reds against yellows. With each goal conceded, the team loses a player: 4v4, goal → 4v3; goal → 4v2. After every 4v2 or 3v1 situation, it restarts with a 4v4. If the team in a 3v4 scores, they remove 1 player from the opponents and add 1 of their own, so we will have a 4v3, whereas a 4v2 becomes a 3v3. In 4v4 and 3v3 and numerical inferiority, free touch. In numerical superiority, 2 touches. SCORING: a goal scored in equal and numerical superiority is worth 1 point; in 3v4 and 2v3 it is worth 2 points, in 2v4 and 1v3 it is worth 4 points.

**Variations:**
You can insert 1 or more wildcards.
