**Progression:**
Educationally, a 3v3 game is played on half of the field. Fully, with throw-ins, corners, and goalkeeper's throw-ins. Only after a goal, the restart will be from the coach who will place a ball at mid-field. The game is played with two touches, and before scoring a goal, a pass must be made to one of the two sidelines, which will act in a corner of the field (corner plus the two sides). Whoever passes to the sideline will take its place. Every time the ball is regained, or the game starts from a throw-in, one should aim to reach the sideline to shoot. The defense will act inversely: they will try to prevent the ball from reaching the sideline and, if it does, to stop the shot at the goal.
