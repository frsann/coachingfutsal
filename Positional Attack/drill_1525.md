**Short description:**
Collective Tactics â€“ Breaking the Press

**Objectives:**
Exit from pressing, with play towards the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10 to 20 minutes

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 4 forwards, and 4 defenders.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper cannot play the ball beyond the halfway line. It starts with a 3 versus 3, before passing the ball to the pivot, players must complete 3 passes. The player who passes the ball joins the attack, their direct opponent follows and defends. We will have a situation of 2 versus 1. The attacker who last touched the ball leaves the field, and the situation resumes with a 3 versus 3. The challenge is won by the team that scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
Introduce ball touch limits.
