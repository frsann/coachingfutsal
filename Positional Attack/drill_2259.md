DANI RODRIGUEZ VIDEO FROM 1:17:52 to 1:29:00
• 1° The ball starts on the side, is played to the center, the one who initiates the action goes between the lines, receives from the opposite lateral, and serves the other trio, "simulating" a pass to the PIVOT (the central then goes to take position where the action started, the lateral who served between the lines moves to the middle, and the lateral who started takes the opposite side).
• 2° Identical movement, but position the "cone" so that the ball between the lines cannot be played, forcing the opposite lateral who receives to serve the central who has widened on the opposite side and will serve "down the line" to the other trio.
• 3° Same movement, but the central who moved to the side cannot pass through and thus plays it back to the player in the middle, cuts, and an insertion from the center towards the side is made using the cut.
• 4° This time it's the central who starts the action by making a "curtain" (on the side he wants), the receiving player attacks the ball, switches the side, and the one who receives makes an insertion for the other "trio."
• 5° Same development, but the opposite lateral who receives cannot make an insertion, plays the ball back to the one who served him, and at this point, there can be an insertion to the pivot or switching to another side for play between the lines.
