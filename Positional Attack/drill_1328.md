**Progression:**
Content: Collective defense measures. Defensive organization in the 1-1-2-1 system. Changing markings, space domination, defensive adjustments, ball pressure, realistic play on 40x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers + 1 Joker attacker per team. The Joker attacker of each team moves along the sidelines in the area from the goal-line to the 10m line. Each Joker holds a ball in their hands, which they will use in the following way when given the ball in play: If they release the ball from their hand, they continue with the ball received in the direction of their team's attack. If they discard the ball received with the ball from their hand, they introduce it into play attacking in the opposite direction from the initial direction of attack. The player who passes the ball to the Joker takes their place. The defensive team always strives to play "Defense by Substitution" 1-1-2-1 and therefore must reorganize quickly through retreating.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time shot counts.
