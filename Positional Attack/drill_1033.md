**Short description:**
Collective Tactics â€“ Breaking Out of the Press

**Objectives:**
Exit from pressing, concentration, and adaptation to unpredictable situations

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
12 players: 2 goalkeepers, 4 forwards, 4 defenders, and 2 wildcards.

**Materials:**
3 balls: 1 for the match, 1 for each joker. Bibs to define the teams. Cones: to define the operational area of the joker, 8 meters from the baseline.

**Progression:**
The game is played 5 against 5. The team in possession of the ball, once they cross the midfield (driving and/or passing into space), can voluntarily kick the ball out of bounds so that their team's joker can put the ball back in play with hands or feet. The challenge is won by the team that scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
You can place the joker on the corner kick spot. If the ball is thrown out, one goal is attacked, if possession is maintained, the other is attacked. Every time the ball is thrown out, the joker passes the ball and enters the field, while the other player takes their place.
