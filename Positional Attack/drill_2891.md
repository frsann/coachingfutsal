**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
- 3x3 is played on a 20x20 field with 2 pivots per team on each side of the goal. - To finalize, we must connect with the pivot and we have 2 touches to finish. If we take more touches, we have to reconnect with the pivot. Observations: - Quick ball circulation - Game progression with the pivot thanks to the collaboration of 2 or 3 players - Defend and close the passing lanes to the pivot to prevent the opponent from advancing.

**Variations:**
- A player who has played on a pivot cannot complete the action.
- Pivot can finish the action.
- One of the 2 pivots always has the ball in hand. The ball can only be received by the pivot who does not have the ball in hand.
