**Progression:**
It starts with a 2vs2, once the ball is played to the pivot positioned on one side, the defense becomes active and can transition. When the pivot receives the ball, they can choose whether to turn to score a goal, serve the overlapping player, or play the ball back to the 3rd player. At that point, the pivot goes to "help" them with a block or screen. When the ball goes out, the game resumes with another action.
