**Progression:**
Content: Collective defensive measures. Defensive organization in the 1-1-2-1 system. Changing marking, space domination, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball, realistic play on 40x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers + 1 Joker attacker per team. The Joker attacker of each team moves along the sideline in the area from the goal line to the 10m line. Each Joker holds a ball in their hands which will be used in the following way when the ball used in play is passed to them: If they release the ball from their hand, they continue with the ball received in the direction of their team's attack. If they deflect the ball received with the ball in hand and put it into play, they attack in the opposite direction from the initial attack direction. The player who passes the ball to the Joker takes their place. The defensive team always strives to play "Defense by exchanges" 1-1-2-1 and therefore must quickly reorganize through retreating.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time shot counts.
