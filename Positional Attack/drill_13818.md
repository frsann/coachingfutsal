**Progression:**
The back (3) moves diagonally to the pivot's (4) position, as the pivot simultaneously shifts to the back's (1) position. Back (1) moves to the last (2) position, while it covers the vacancy left by back (3). At that moment, the last (2) continues moving along the line and opens the diagonal with a feint motion, while back (3) makes a false motion to the right then moves down to the left on the line to receive the ball. Back (3) plays to back (1) - if back (1) plays to back (3), the last (2) covers the second post, back (1) goes for the return, and the pivot (4) remains as the backup - if back (1) plays a long diagonal to the last (2), back (1) covers the second post, the pivot (4) goes for the return, and back (3) stays as the backup.

**Variations:**
- limit the number of touches
- introduce playing at first touch
- individual action of the pivot after receiving the ball
