**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Juanito's work with the team is aimed at developing play in width. One of the sub-principles of the Spanish coach's game model is to have wide play to then seek depth. This approach is to stimulate this detail, provoke it, and work on it during training sessions.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the playing field is divided into zones, each with a different number of ball touches. In the central part, play is allowed with one touch; in the area extending to the perimeter lines of the basketball court, play is allowed with two touches; in all the space outside the basketball court up to the perimeter lines of the Futsal field, there is free touch play. Naturally, the player will seek width to work the ball, as there are no touch limitations in the widest part of the field. Therefore, for the same reason, they will try to get as close as possible to the opponent's goal to finalize, as in the last 6 meters they will have complete freedom to find the best solution.
