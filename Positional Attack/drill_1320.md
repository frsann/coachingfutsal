# Drill 1320

**Short description:**
Real game 4v4 + goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. Attack both goals when crossing the center line.

**Objectives:**
Improve the collective defensive aspects of defense in individual pressing to prevent the advancement of the game.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
8 + g

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Individual defense. Getting out of the press. If the ball crosses the center line with a ground pass or by dribbling, attackers can attack either of the two goals. If the attackers switch sides with a high ball, they can attack the goal they were assigned before the start of the attack. The attack always starts from the goalkeeper of the team that holds possession, and the ball must always cross the center line for the attack to go towards both goals. The defensive aim is to prevent the ball from progressing through pressure on the ball via individual defense, thus preventing a controlled transition to the other side of the field. Insist on pressuring the ball during its travel by controlling the space between the defensive player and the attacker and through coverage and space control as a counter defender to prevent game advancement if one defensive player is bypassed. Close the passing lines to the opponent with the ball, those that conquer space through passes to the pivot or other reference players.

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts.
