Improvement of the defensive collective aspects of defense through substitutions, individual foundations, group concepts for the development of individual defense with substitutions of opponents based on game reading, developing basic concepts of perception - decision making.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts

**Progression:**
Group defensive principles of 3 players.. Substituting marking, space control, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball. Real game on 28x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. Pressure on the ball, substituting marking, covering against defenders, defensive orientation when pressing the ball (center), space control when pressing the ball, adjusting the first line of defense when an opposing player appears behind it on the side opposite the ball, working on defensive triangles. Intensity when pressing the ball, reducing the distance from the player receiving the ball during its trajectory. Quick positioning, preventing direct passes (goalkeeper to pivot). Individual position adjustment after the goalkeeper's throw-in. Attention to perceptual concepts important for decision-making in defense: the ball is a reference point, defensive orientation, defensive orientation of the player marking the opponent with the ball. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the team that scored will initiate the next attack. We create 2 teams of three players each with substitutes.

**Variations:**
Only the first shot counts.
