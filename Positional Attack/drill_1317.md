**Progression:**
Real game on 20x20, 4v4 + Goalkeeper for both teams. Goal only from first touch from 6m. Attack only on one side where there are two goals. We are working on the attack on one side, attacking two goals located on the goal-line but within the 6m area (see picture). When the defensive team wins the ball or the ball goes out of play as a result of good defensive play, the goalkeeper puts the ball in play by passing it to the team that won the ball. At that moment, the roles of defense and attack switch. We explain the basics of perception for reading the game and controlling space and coverage by paying attention to the ball, opposing players, the ball, the direct opponent, etc. Pressure on the ball when it arrives to prevent it from approaching the defended goal. When the orientation of the game is on the opposite side from my position on the field, work on space control and coverage. Read situations to help a teammate in 1v1 situations.

**Variations:**
Concede a goal by the other, weaker foot.
