# Drill 370

**Short description:**
The pressure release initiated by the goalkeeper begins (we can include all movements, as well as the variations).

**Objectives:**
Automate pressure release with a 2 x 2 continuation + Pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
20x30

**Duration (min):**
10 minutes (rotate all players in the exit movement, including the pivot).

**Number of players:**
10 – 12 players + 2 goalkeepers + 1 player who performs the role of Pivot.

**Materials:**
Balls, vests, goals, and cones.

**Progression:**
The pressure exit indicated by the goalkeeper begins (we can include all movements, as well as the variations). The attackers progress in the exit with the 4 players to finish (2 touches are played). Once they have finished, the task continues (the last two players to touch the ball "drop back," and the other two become attackers). The goalkeeper of the goal where they finished has to make a quick throw-in to create a 2x2 + Pivot situation.

**Variations:**
The name of the players who fall back is mentioned by the "goalkeeper" or a coach assistant. The tasks can be continued with different situations of superiority (3 x 1 – 3 x 2 with a wildcard in the center).

**Categories:**
Positional Attack - Exit Pressing, Positional Defense - Pressing
