Content: Collective defensive measures. Defensive organization in the 1-1-2-1 system. Switching marking, space domination, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball, real play on 40x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers + 1 Joker attacker per team. Each team's Joker attacker moves along the sidelines in the area from the goal line to the 10m line. Each Joker holds a ball in his hands, which he will use as follows when passed the ball being played: If he releases the ball from his hand, he continues with the ball he received in the direction of his team's attack. If he discards the ball he received with the ball from his hand that he throws into the play, he attacks in the opposite direction from the initial attack direction. The player who passes the ball to the Joker takes his place. The defensive team always strives to play "Defense by substitution" 1-1-2-1 and therefore must quickly reorganize through retreating.
