**Duration (min):**
10-15

10 + gks

**Materials:**

**Progression:**
A real game on a 28x20 field, 3v3 + 2 Joker attackers per team (1 from each longitudinal side) + goalkeepers. Each of the four jokers has a ball with which they can enter the game every time an attacker from their team exits with the ball controlled on their side. The jokers must always be on the attacking half of the field, while players exiting can do so from any part of the field. We apply defensive guidelines: Yonska defenses, coverage, space control based on perceptual patterns (game orientation, ball pressure, etc.). Pay special attention to zonal defensive rotations with the goal of repositioning the zonal defense every time the substitution of a Joker and a player causes defensive problems due to the breached first line of defense.

**Variations:**
Only the first goal counts.

Positional Attack, Positional Defense
