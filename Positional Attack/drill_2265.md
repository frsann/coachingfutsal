# Drill 2265

**Short description:**
Three players (two wing players and one back) execute a sequence and pass the ball to another trio who repeat the same.

**Objectives:**
Progress in the development of the 3-1 attacking system.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
3 minutes after the sequence

**Number of players:**
6 per group

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
•1. Sequence: The right winger passes the ball to the last player and moves into the interline. The last player passes the ball to the left winger and spreads to the right. The left winger passes the ball to the right winger for a support pass, and after it's returned, controls and drops it to the "pivot." •2. Sequence: Exactly the same as in Sequence 1: The right winger passes the ball to the last player and moves into the interline. The last player passes the ball to the left winger and spreads to the right. The left winger passes the ball to the right winger for a support pass, and after it's returned, controls and tries to drop it to the "pivot." After failing, he passes the ball to the last player who spreads towards the sideline, and the received ball is dropped to the "pivot" along the line. •3. Sequence: Exactly the same as in Sequence 2: The right winger passes the ball to the last player and moves into the interline. The last player passes the ball to the left winger and spreads to the right. The left winger passes the ball to the right winger for a support pass, and after it's returned, controls and tries to drop it to the "pivot." After failing, he passes the ball to the last player who spreads towards the sideline, and the received ball is attempted to be dropped to the "pivot" along the line. After failing, he returns the ball to the player in the middle and runs through so that the player with the ball can diagonally drop it to the "pivot" behind the back of the running teammate. •4. Sequence: The last player starts the action by passing the ball to one of the wingers and makes a "screen" on the same side (running between the player with the ball and the opponent marking him, pressing). The winger controls the ball and switches sides to the other winger who drops to the "pivot" after controlling, or on the first touch. •5. Sequence: Exactly the same as in Sequence 4: The last player starts the action by passing the ball to one of the wingers and makes a "screen" on the same side (running between the player with the ball and the opponent marking him, pressing). The winger controls the ball and switches sides to the other winger who cannot drop to the "pivot" after controlling or on the first touch and returns it to the teammate who gave him the ball, and he drops it to the pivot on the first touch or switches the play for a pass to the pivot between the lines. •6. Sequence: Exactly the same as in Sequence 5: The last player starts the action by passing the ball to one of the wingers and makes a "screen" on the same side (running between the player with the ball and the opponent marking him, pressing). The winger controls the ball and switches sides to the other winger who cannot drop to the "pivot" after controlling or on the first touch and returns it to the teammate who gave him the ball, and he drops it to the pivot on the first touch or switches the play for a pass to the pivot between the lines. Take a look at this!

**Variations:**
Dropping from the first to the "pivot" is mandatory. Introduce passing with the heel and then dropping to the "pivot".
