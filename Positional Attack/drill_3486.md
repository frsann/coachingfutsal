**Objectives:**
first line of defense, defensive triangle, space dominance

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
8+8

**Number of players:**
8

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
first version: it starts 4vs4 as in the video with the 2 central players passing back and forth; when a side is chosen, the receiver returns the ball immediately to the central player who passed it, and that is the signal for the 3 who will participate in the attack. From that moment, the REAL defense begins. The defender-attacker pair on the other side exits the field. To score, the attack must carry the ball past the midfield line.

second version: it always starts 4vs4, but one defender has the ball in hand and cannot defend (they must stay still). To defend, they must pass the ball to another teammate in the air. The objective to score remains the same.

**Variations:**
You can choose to play in time or give 5 attacks to each quartet.
