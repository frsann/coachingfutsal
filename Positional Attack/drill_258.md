**Objectives:**
I play with Pivot

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
2 series of 5 minutes

**Number of players:**
8 Players + 2 Goalkeepers (each team has a player positioned as a Pivot, in a designated area)

**Materials:**
Goals, cones, bibs.

**Progression:**
A 3 x 3 is played on a 28 x 20, and each team has a pivot that moves freely throughout the zone. The player acting as the pivot cannot finish but can only assist their teammate when they receive the ball. The objective is to play with the pivot to work on "drop" actions, "third man." It is also valid to score a goal without playing with the pivot. If there is a corner kick, the PIVOT takes it.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of passes. If a goal is scored, when playing with a pivot, it counts as DOUBLE. The pivot can score. The goalkeeper can play directly to the PIVOT with their hand.
