The game is played 2v2 on each half of the field. There are 2 touches in the defensive half, and it's free in the attacking half. When the goalkeeper passes the ball to the attackers in the defensive half, a teammate from the attacking half can join them to create a 3v2 situation. If they carry the ball to the attacking half, they have 5 seconds to finish. The attacker from the attacking half and the attacker from the defensive half who passed the ball move to the attacking half. When the play is over, the same player who initiated the action in the defensive half returns to the defensive half. There are no throw-ins or corners.
