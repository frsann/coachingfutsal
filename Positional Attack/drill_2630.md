20x20

8-12' depending on needs

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
The game is played 1v1 on a 20x20 meter area in sequences. The action always starts with the goalkeeper passing to one of the attackers on their left or right side. The defender presses the ball and tries to prevent the attacker from scoring. After the action ends, the attacker becomes the defender and the defender goes in line on the opposite side. Key points: - timely pressure on the ball - defensive positioning - reading the game - closing the middle - not stealing the ball.

**Variations:**
If a defender concedes a goal through the middle, they do 5 push-ups; if they concede a goal along the line, they do 5 push-ups. An attacker in the opposite corner can cover the far post.
