**Progression:**
VIDEO DANI RODRIGUEZ FROM 1:17:52 to 1:29:00
1° The ball starts on the side, is played in the middle, the initiator of the action moves between the lines and receives from the opposite flank, simulating a service to the PIVOT (the central player then moves to the starting position, the flank player who served between the lines moves to the center, and the starting flank player takes the opposite side).
2° The same movement, but place the "cone" so the ball cannot be played between the lines, forcing the opposite flank receiver to serve the central player who has moved wide to the opposite side, who will then serve "along the line" to the other trio.
3° The same movement, but the central player who has shifted to the side cannot find a through pass and plays it back to the middle player, makes a cut, and a through pass is made from the center towards the side utilizing the cut.
4° This time it's the central player who starts the action by setting a "screen" (on the side he chooses), the receiver attacks the ball, switches the side, and the receiver makes a through pass to the other "trio".
5° The same development, but the opposite flank receiver cannot make a through pass, plays the ball back to the previous server, and at this point, there can be a through pass to the pivot or a switch to the other side for a play between the lines.
