**Progression:**
Educationally, players are divided into two teams of 4 players with 2 goalkeepers. It starts with a 2vs2 in one half of the field, prioritizing the improvement of primary collaborations, both offensive and defensive. Once the 2vs2 is over, the coach immediately puts a ball back into play in the other half of the field for a 2vs2 trying to relieve pressure, to which a third attacking player can be added for a 3vs2. In order to unlock the play, an attacker must carry the ball past the halfway line, and at that point, it becomes a 4vs4 game.
