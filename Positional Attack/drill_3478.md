# Drill 3478

**Short description:**
Real game 4v4 + goalkeepers on 40x20. Attack on both goals when crossing the center line.

**Objectives:**
Improve collective defensive aspects of defense in individual pressing to avoid game progression.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
8 + g

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Individual defense. Exiting the press. If the ball crosses the center line by passing on the ground or dribbling, attackers can attack either of the two goals. If the attackers cross to the other side with a high ball, they can attack the goal assigned to them before the start of the attack. The attack always starts from the goalkeeper of the team in possession of the ball, and the ball always has to cross the center line for the attack to be on both goals. The defensive aim is to prevent the advancement of the ball through pressure on the ball with individual defense, thus preventing a controlled crossover to the other side of the field. Insist on pressure on the ball during its journey by controlling the space between the defensive player and the attacker, as well as through coverage and control of space as a counter defender to avoid the progression of play if one defensive player is bypassed. Close the passing lines of the opponent with the ball, those that gain space through passes to the pivot or other reference players.

**Variations:**
Only the first goal counts.
