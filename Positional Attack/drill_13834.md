**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
9 + mvt

**Materials:**

**Progression:**
Three-player group defense principles, switches + markings, space management, defense adjustments, ball pressure. Realistic game 20x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the scoring player starts a new attack. Two teams of three players. Ball pressing, marking changes, covering the opponent, defense direction while pressing the ball (in the middle), space management while pressing the ball, adjusting the first defensive line when the opponent appears behind it from the unpressured side. Intensity when pressing the ball, reduce the distance to the player receiving the ball during its movement. Quick positioning to prevent direct pass. Individual posture adjustment after throw-ins by goalkeepers. Retreat if the first defensive line is bypassed. Attention to observational concepts that are essential in making defensive decisions: the ball is a reference point, direction of defense.

**Variations:**
Addition of a joker -> effect on the defensive formation
