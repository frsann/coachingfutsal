# Drill 13815

Escaping the press through the rotation of the last 3 players

**Objectives:**
Breaking the press by rotating the back three players, while the pivot uses deceptive movement to find space to receive the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15-20

**Number of players:**
"8 + 2 goalkeepers minimum"

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
The wingback (2) and wingback (3) move towards the center, and wingback (3) returns towards the goal through a feint movement. Wingback (2) separates diagonally to the opposite side through a feint movement, and the pivot (4) opens space on the right side after feigning movement to the opposite side. At the moment when the pivot (4) opens to the right side, the last man (1) goes to secure the line and provides support to the pivot (4), while the wingback (3) moves down to the place of the last man.

**Variations:**
- limit the number of touches allowed for the pivot - introduce first-touch play - active collaboration between the pivot and back or individual actions of the pivot - introduce a defensive player with passive and semi-passive play
