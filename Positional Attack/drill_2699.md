# Drill 2699

**Short description:**
3x3 and 20x20 with free touches, two pivots and a defender in 10x20 with two touches.

**Objectives:**
I play with pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20 (2 areas of 10x20 and one area of 20x20).

**Duration (min):**
6 minutes.

**Number of players:**
12 players + 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Goals, balls, and bibs.

**Progression:**
A 3 x 3 game is played on the central 20 x 20 field with free touches. On the 10 x 20 field, two pivots and a defender are placed, and they play with two touches. The players on the central field can "connect" with one of the pivots (when one receives, the other pivot becomes unusable). When the pivot receives, only one attacker can enter the zone. The goal is also valid from the central zone.

**Variations:**
Leave the game touch-free in all areas. The goal of "connecting with pivot" is worth double.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack
