**Area (mxm):**
40 by 20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
In terms of teaching, three quartets are used: one in possession escapes the pressure brought by the second quartet and a third quartet is on the other half of the field, positioned as the coach predetermines. In this case, two players are at the back of the field and two players are on the side of the half. The game typically unfolds with one team breaking the pressure and the other team pressing. The limit is the half-field line. If the team in possession manages to overcome the pressure, it attacks against the other quartet, which can only enter play once the ball crosses the half-field line. If the pressing team recovers the ball, either actively or passively (the possessing team sends the ball out), it attacks on the other side against the waiting quartet, which will enter play once the ball crosses the half-field line.

The activity is extremely comprehensive as it uses an ultra-offensive pressure phase, with the 4 defenders beyond the half-field line; it involves a phase of pressure exit against a very high defensive intensity; it leads to a transition phase before a positional attack against a half-field defense. The half-field defense follows a negative transition phase starting from rear positions, with a significant distance from the ball.
