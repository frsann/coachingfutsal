# Drill 3511

**Short description:**
Exercise carried out on Monday, January 27, 2020, at the beginning of the Banfield Futsal preseason.

**Objectives:**
It combines defensive and offensive tactical aspects by constantly switching roles in a 2vs2 game where the direction is reversed when connecting with the pivot joker.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Three quartets - rotating the rest; blocks of 2 minutes and 6 repetitions in total. 2vs2 coming out from pressure, once the ball is served to the pivot in the middle, the same pair must attack the goal they came from, and the pair that was trying to prevent the connection with the pivot must now defend the goal. On the other half of the field, there will be the same exact exercise, but the man in the middle will always be the same and must therefore be attentive to what is happening on both halves of the field. If the pressing defense steals the ball, they can attempt a direct attack on the goal. If the defense defending the goal steals the ball, they must connect with the pivot to be able to attack. There are throw-ins. If the ball goes out the end line or when attempting to connect with the pivot, play restarts from the goalkeeper.
