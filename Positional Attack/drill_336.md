**Short description:**
How to attack a man-to-man defense with switches.

**Objectives:**
How to attack an individual defense with switches.

**Area (mxm):**
Midfield.

**Duration (min):**
10 minutes (rotate so that all players go through all positions).

**Number of players:**
10 players + 2 goalkeepers (to switch during the task).

**Materials:**
Balls, cones, and bibs.

**Progression:**
The task begins with two fixed defenders + 2 cones (defensive situation). The attackers are positioned: 1 as a fixed wing passer + 3 groups of players rotating. The ball starts in the center and always passes to the wing and moves to "stop" between lines. The wing player has 3 options: play with the pivot, play between lines, or play to the third man. The defenders perform 4 defenses and change roles / the passer also rotates at the same time.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches. Limit the number of passes to finish.
