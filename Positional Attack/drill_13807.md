**Short description:**
"from VADILLO USCITA PRESSING_4.MP4 from 00:00 to 02:45 explanation on body orientation when receiving a ball and cutting a line"

**Objectives:**
Exit pressing and body orientation

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
2vs2 with 2 jokers in my half of the field. I am not obliged to incorporate the jokers. If I pass to the joker on the right, the opposite joker enters to defend from the other side and vice versa. To pass, I must be on the half (dividing the field vertically) of the joker's side (I can't make a deep pass towards the joker). This is because Vadillo doesn’t want passes of 16-18 meters that favor interceptions in his team. Care should be taken with the joker's posture when they enter as they must gain and attack the space when receiving. It is not mandatory to play with the joker, otherwise, the defense would always close the side without focusing on the 2vs2 duels. Note the correction around 06:20 on the futility of bringing in a joker with a backward pass. CONCEPT: GENERATE AN ADVANTAGE. Before passing the ball to the joker, I must "challenge the opponent"… I shouldn’t pass with the defender able to "easily intercept." With the first entry, it becomes 3vs3 but the other can also be brought in until it's 4vs4. Each team gets one attack (once the whites and once the greens) unless a goal is scored.
