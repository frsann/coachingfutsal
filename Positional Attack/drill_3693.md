The 3 attackers cannot exceed 10 meters but can move freely. A "leader" will be identified who can move, and his 2 companions must stay 1-2 meters close to him. The defenders must move accordingly to be ready to press. A coach from outside serves the goalkeeper a ball. When the goalkeeper receives the ball, you can move freely to get open. FOCUS ON ATTACK.
