**Progression:**
The game is played 2v2 in each half of the field. Two touches are allowed in the defensive half, and free in the attacking half. When the goalkeeper passes the ball to the attackers in the defensive half, one teammate from the attacking half can join to create a 3v2 situation. If they transfer the ball to the attacking half, they have 5 seconds to complete the play. The attacker from the attacking half and the attacker from the defensive half who passed the ball join in the attacking half. When the action is finished, the same player who started the action from the defensive half returns there. There are no throw-ins or corners. The ball is always in possession from the goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
- Change the number of touches.
- Change the time for the endgame.
- A player who did not pass the ball advances to the attacking half.
- A player of choice advances to the attacking half.
- The nearest player can return to the defensive half.
