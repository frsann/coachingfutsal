# Drill 3253

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Sylvio Rocha's activity fits into those group activities that, even by using manipulation of the field dimensions, aim to recreate game dynamics, deconstructing them, and pushing to ensure that the reviewed dynamics are mostly those that the coach desires.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Tactically, in a 28x20 field, a 3vs3 game is played with one joker for each team in the pivot position. The latter is limited in playing space, as he only moves within the last 6 meters and is limited in ball touches, as he can only finalize using one touch, and if he stops the ball and uses more than one touch, he must pass. The rest of the players on the field play with free touches and are not obliged to pass through the pivot; they move the game in all its dynamics. However, to exploit an offensive numerical superiority, they pass through the pivot and thus create situations more aligned with the coach's desires and training objectives.
