# Drill 2068

**Short description:**
A game with 3 attackers on their own half collaborating with a teammate in the center circle. Additionally, there are 3 defensive players on the same half and one defensive player on the opposite half. Both teams have 2 pivots positioned deep.

**Objectives:**
Collaboration with the pivot and creating offensive and defensive triangles (attack phase) Closing passing lanes and making it difficult to cooperate with the central player, as well as constricting against the flank player (defense phase)

**Area (mxm):**
40m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
10-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
12

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
The ball starts from the goalkeeper who plays it to the blue team. Through collaboration with the central teammate, we achieve a numerical advantage of 6 vs 4 and seek cooperation with the pivot. The defense in the first third of the field plays very aggressively, and we ensure that the opposite flank comes closer to attack the passing line and create pressure on the ball. When switching to our half, the goal is to close the passing lines to the center and the pivot as effectively as possible. If the defense wins the ball in the front line, the goal is to score with its pivots, and a fourth player joins the attack phase.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches in your and the opponent's half, allow cooperation with the pivot and from your half of the field, require both pivots to touch the ball, allow the pivot to strike towards the goal.
