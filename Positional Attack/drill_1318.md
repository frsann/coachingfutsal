**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
3v3 on 28X20. Mandatory individual defense. A realistic game through which we influence individual aspects of marking and the basics of defensive cooperation (help, cover, etc.). We can dictate different positions of the first line when starting to press the ball, in order to work in situations of individual defense when pressing, open defense, half-court defense, or closed defense. We will use 3-4 teams that we will occasionally rotate.

**Variations:**
Goal from the first.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Positional Defense
