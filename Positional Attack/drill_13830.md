# Drill 13830

**Short description:**
3vs3 + pivot with 2 goalkeepers

**Objectives:**
The idea is the pressing of the defensive team and the exit from the pressing of the team with the ball, with an emphasis on the appearance of the pivot. That is why the pivot is alone, to first learn to appear outside the passing line. At the moment the pivot receives the ball, only he and the player who passed it to him go into the final phase. If the opposing team takes the ball, a quick finish is necessary.
