**Objectives:**
Zone defense. We are working on improving the collective defensive aspects of Zone defense, enhancing the two-player defensive line, and gaining space against zone defense through numerical superiority 3v2.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
12 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide 40x20 into three equal zones, approximately 13x20 each. The game is played with 4 attackers and 6 defenders + goalkeepers. The 6 defenders are distributed in pairs in each zone without the possibility of entering other zones. The condition for attackers is that a maximum of three can be in the same zone. The goal is to perfect defensive lines in zonal defense composed of two players against 3 attackers. Before each role change, two players from the former defensive team leave while two players from the former attacking team enter.

**Variations:**
Let's limit the number of attacker touches.
