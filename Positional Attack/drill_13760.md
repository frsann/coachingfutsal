# Drill 13760

**Short description:**
Proposed by Riccardo Grassi of The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
attack against set defense, pressing, counter-pressing (gegenpressing)

**Area (mxm):**
25x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Divide the group into teams of 4 + 1 goalkeepers on a normal-sized field. (In fact, the activity can also be carried out in just one half of the field) The activity focuses on attacking against positional defense, with positive and/or negative transitions. One team will have possession for one minute. They cannot be challenged behind the halfway line. The time will not stop when the ball is out. The team in possession can take both throw-ins and corners. They will restart from the halfway line in case of a throw-in or goal kick in favor of the defending team. *If the defending team recovers the ball and maintains possession for a minimum of 3 seconds (coach counts out loud), the game ends (even before the established minute) and the defending team will start the one-minute possession.

**Variations:**


**Categories:**
