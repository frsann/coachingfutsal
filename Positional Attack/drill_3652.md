# Drill 3652

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
This activity that Neto proposes is perfect for composing real play moments, so that a "free match" doesn't fill up the time of our session without having constraints that turn that moment of real play into a true experience of situations, problems, solutions, behaviors.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
By dividing the players into 2 teams, different quartets can be used for each composition of moments. Didactically, it starts with a 4vs3 scenario that can be programmed as if there had been a player expulsion. The defending team, once they regain possession of the ball (either actively by recovering it, passively with the ball going out of play, or by conceding a goal), must connect with one of the two pivots at the end of the field, in the corners on the opposite side. After the connection, the pivot cannot shoot at the goal, and a 4vs4 play develops. Regardless of how this play concludes, it will restart with a corner kick for the team that connected with the pivot. And regardless of the outcome of the corner kick, it will restart with the defending team breaking the pressure situation. In the end, it will begin again with the 4vs3 with inverted teams. To summarize, the moments are composed in a training step that will cyclically repeat: 
- 4vs3 due to expulsion (attack and defense)
- Development in 3 to connect with a pivot
- 4vs4
- Corner (attack and defense)
- Breaking the pressure
