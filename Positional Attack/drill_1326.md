Improving the defensive collective aspects of Defense through substitutions, individual foundations, group concepts for developing individual defense with opponent substitutions based on game reading, developing basic concepts of perception - decision-making.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, graphic t-shirts

**Progression:**
Group defensive principles of 3 players... Marking substitution, space control, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball. Real play on 28x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. Pressure on the ball, marking substitution, covering against defenders, defensive orientation when pressing the ball (center), space control when pressing the ball, adjusting the first line of defense when an opposing player appears behind it, on the side opposite the ball, working on defensive triangles. Intensity when pressing the ball, reducing the distance from the player receiving the ball during its trajectory. Quick positioning, prevent direct passing (goalkeeper to pivot). Individual position adjustment after goalkeeper throw-in. Attention to perceptive concepts important for decision-making in defense: the ball is the reference point, defensive orientation, defensive orientation of the player marking the opponent with the ball. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the team that scored will initiate the new attack. We create 2 teams of three players each with substitutions.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time goal counts.
