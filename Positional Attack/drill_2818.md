**Number of players:**

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the 12 players are divided into 3 quartets with only one goal to defend and attack, with a goalkeeper. One quartet attacks the goal, one quartet defends it, and one quartet waits in the other half of the field at the 10-meter mark, ready to attack with the ball. The objective of the team attacking the goal is to score a goal and then prevent the defending team from breaking out of pressure. The latter will try to cross the midfield and pass the ball to the waiting team. In this case, the team that receives the ball will attack the goal, the team that was previously attacking and pressing will find itself defending the goal, and the team that successfully exited the pressure while defending will position itself in the opposite half of the field to receive and subsequently attack.

**Variations:**
It could also be played in a 3 vs 3 format in case of a different number of players available. The game is practiced in its entirety.
