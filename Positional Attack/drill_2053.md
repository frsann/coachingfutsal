# Drill 2053

**Short description:**
Defense with substitutions. Real game on 28x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers.

**Objectives:**
Improvement of the defensive collective aspects of Defense with substitutions, individual foundations, group concepts for the development of individual defense with opponent substitutions based on game reading, developing basic concepts of perception - decision making.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
October 15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts

**Progression:**
Group defensive principles for 3 players: Switching marking, space control, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball. Real game on 28x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. Pressure on the ball, switching marking, covering the counter-back, defensive orientation when pressing the ball (center), space control when pressing the ball, adjusting the first line of defense when an opposing player appears behind it on the side opposite the ball, working on defensive triangles. Intensity when pressing the ball, reducing the distance from the player receiving the ball while it is in trajectory. Quick positioning, preventing direct passing (goalkeeper to pivot). Individual position adjustment after the goalkeeper's throw-in. Attention to perceptual concepts crucial for decision-making in defense: the ball as a reference point, defensive orientation, defensive orientation of the player marking the opponent with the ball. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the team that scored the goal will initiate the new attack. We create 2 teams of three players each with substitutes.

**Variations:**
Only a goal from the first attempt counts, limit the game to 3 touches.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Positional Defense
