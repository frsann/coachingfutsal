# Drill 3300

**Short description:**
The game is played 3v3 in the central zone 20x20 plus the back and pivot below the 10m line.

**Objectives:**

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on the needs"

**Number of players:**
At least 10 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We play across the entire field, which we divide into 3 zones: 2 outer zones of 10x20m and one central zone of 20x20m. In the outer zones, teams have a goalkeeper and a pivot, but the goalkeeper can only defend on the 10m line, although they can enter the zone after the ball enters. Until that moment, they only work on anticipation. In the central zone, the game is 3v3, and players must connect with the pivot in the outer zone. They can only enter the finishing zone once their pivot receives the ball. The pivot can also defend the attack but always within the outer zone. Once they receive the ball, they play with two touches and can either finish or connect with one of the teammates who will be able to enter the finishing zone once the pivot receives the ball.

**Variations:**
A goal can also be scored with a shot from the central zone. The pivot can step in front of the defender for 2-3 seconds, and if the ball doesn't come to him, he must go back behind the last defender and try to connect again.
