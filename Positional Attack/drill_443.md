# Drill 443

**Short description:**
3x3 on a 20x20 field with free touches, two pivots and a defender on a 10x20 field with two touches.

**Objectives:**
I play with pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20 (2 zones of 10x20 and one zone of 20x20).

**Duration (min):**
6 minutes.

**Number of players:**
12 players + 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Goals, balls, and vests.

**Progression:**
A 3 x 3 game is played on the central 20 x 20 court with unlimited touches. On the 10 x 20 court, two pivots and a defender play with two touches. Players on the central court can “connect” with one of the pivots (when one receives, the other pivot is deactivated). When the pivot receives, only one attacker can enter the zone. A goal is also valid from the central zone.

**Variations:**
Leave the game free of touches in all areas. The goal of "connection with pivot" has double value.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack
