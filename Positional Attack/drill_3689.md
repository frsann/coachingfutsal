# Drill 3689

**Short description:**
Vadillo's exercise to train plays with three plus a pivot and center and stimulate activation upon losing the ball.

**Objectives:**
activation after loss  
pressure on the ball  
positional attack 3-1

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
11 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Evolution of task 2 (3+3+3+pivot) instead of starting from a throw-in, it starts from the center of the attack to train positional attack in 3-1. In defense, there is a stopper who always goes with the team that is defending and who individually marks the pivot. The dynamic is similar to task two but now in a 4x4 situation + defensive goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
The pivot and the back stay stationary when the attacking team loses the ball (leaving the situation at 3x3 + team in waiting), the pivot and the back are involved in case of ball loss. The pivot activates after the loss, and the back works to relieve pressure by connecting with the team in waiting.
