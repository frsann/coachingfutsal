# Drill 3477

**Short description:**
Defense with substitutions. A real game on a 20x20 field, 3v3 + goalkeepers.

**Objectives:**
Improvement of defensive collective aspects of defense with substitutions, individual foundations, group concepts for the development of individual defense with opponent substitutions based on reading the game, developing basic concepts of perception - decision-making.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
Marked T-shirts, balls

**Progression:**
Group defensive principles for 3 players, switching marking, space control, defensive adjustments, pressing the ball. Real play on 20x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the team that scored initiates a new attack. Create 2 teams of three players each with substitutions. Pressing the ball, switching marking, covering the counter back, defensive orientation during ball pressure (center), space control during ball pressure, adjusting the first line of defense when an opposing player appears behind from the opposite side of the ball, working on defensive triangles. Intensity during ball pressure, reduce the distance from the player receiving the ball during its path. Quick positioning, prevent direct passing (goalkeeper to pivot). Individual adjustment of position after the goalkeeper's throw-in. Retreat if the first defensive line is crossed. Attention to perceptual concepts important for decision-making in defense: the ball is the reference point, defensive orientation, defensive orientation of the player marking an opponent with the ball.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time shot counts.
