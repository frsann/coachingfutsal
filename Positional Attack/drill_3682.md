# Drill 3682

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
This exercise is suitable for improving combinations and development of both game systems and implicitly in the defensive phase for the appropriate marking/coverage in each aforementioned situation.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
7 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 2vs2 is played with free touch; two players will have 2 lateral bases available for attacks and 4:0 development, while the other 2 can combine with a central base functioning as a pivot. Since it is unmarked, the pivot cannot finalize but can only seek assistance for teammates by working the timing and spacing of combinations as best as possible. The bases themselves have no touch or time limitations, but the expectation from the players at the base is of the highest technical quality to assist teammates (since they are unmarked) and the best possible passing timing to assist teammates in getting free or exploiting space.

**Variations:**


**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Real Game - Modified - Modeled
