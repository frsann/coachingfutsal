8-14' depending on needs

**Number of players:**
At least 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
Real game 4v4 on 40x20 with the condition: If the ball crosses the center of the field on the ground or a player dribbles it to the other side, the attacker can finish the action on either of the two goals. Once the attacker has changed the direction of attack and entered the attacking half, they can no longer change the direction of attack. If the ball crosses the center in the air, the attack continues in the same direction.

**Variations:**
There are no corners or throw-ins. Each time we start from the goalkeeper in possession of the ball. Two touches in the defensive half and free in the attacking half. A goal scored when we move the ball on the ground counts as two goals. When the ball crosses the center on the ground, the attacker can change direction as many times as they want. The losing team does push-ups, sit-ups, etc.
