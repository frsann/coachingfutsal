**Short description:**
the pressing out using a 4:0 game system and in an environment of two teams: the one in offense using 4 players and the one in defense using 5 players, that is, with one who controls and guarantees coverings.The repetitions of movements even before the Coach puts the ball into play, serve to improve the tactical memory of the player for then moving easily in a 4:0 system.The presence of the Coach on the playing field is something we like to emphasize in this video, so that his stimuli and corrections reach the player immediately and that the latter sees the coach always present within the activities.
