All

**Progression:**
The game starts with a goalkeeper in a 3v3 situation. The attacking team has jokers on the flanks, and the defending team has 1 defender waiting on their own half of the field. If a pass can be made over one attacker to the joker, the joker can join the game, and the game continues as a 4v4 until the ball is out of play.

**Variations:**
If the attacking team crosses the halfway line with 3 players, a defender from the defending team must also leave the field, and the game is played as a 3v3 until the end.
