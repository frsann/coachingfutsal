# Drill 3727

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Technical-tactical warm-up proposal that can be carried out on a full field or reduced field with a double transition from analytical work to situational work.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The work structure involves 3 teams already divided into quartets. Goalkeepers defend both goals and are not assigned to any team: - Exiting from analytical pressure, according to the pressure exits used by the team (all based on the system of play and the 3 – 1 development) - On the change of direction, a 3 vs 1 one-touch game will be played, with no limitations on passes between players (situational) - On the next change of direction, it will go back to constructing analytically, this time through the system of play and the 4 X 0 development (it is also possible to leave the choice to the players, so if the first pressure exit called by the goalkeeper is with the 4 X 0 system of play, the following development must be 3 – 1) - The final situational pass involves a 2 vs 2, the ball will be played in by the goalkeeper or the coach to one player, who will choose a teammate (with a simple pass) and consequently, the two defenders must oppose until the action concludes.

**Variations:**
- In the analytical part, as mentioned earlier, we coaches can manipulate it according to the playing system we want to work on, or leave the choice to the initial decision of the goalkeepers with the constraint that the subsequent analytical development must occur with a playing system not previously worked on. - A possible variation could be in the final pass, playing two 1 vs 1 duels instead of a 2 vs 2.
