**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8-12

**Number of players:**

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We play on the whole field, which is divided into three zones. Two outer zones of 10x20m and one central 20x20m. - In the outer zones, teams have a defender and a pivot, but the defender can only defend on the 10m line, although they can enter the zone after the ball enters. Until that point, they only work on anticipation. - In the central zone, it's 3v3 and players must connect with the pivot in the outer zone. They can enter the finishing zone only when their pivot receives the ball. The pivot can also defend the attack, but always within the outer zone. Once they receive the ball, they play on two touches and can either finish or connect with one of the teammates who, once the pivot receives the ball, can enter the finishing zone.

**Variations:**
A goal can be scored with a shot from the central zone. The pivot can step in front of the defender for 2-3 seconds, and if the ball doesn't come to him, he must return behind the last defender and try to connect again.
