**Progression:**
The real game on 40x20, always a defensive shortfall of 3v4 on its own half; the defensive team must press to prevent the opponent from crossing the center. Attackers can advance to the attacking side of the field only after at least two passes in the defensive half. (We may require that they cannot enter the attacking half with a high ball). If the attackers succeed in crossing to the attacking half, the defensive team has two choices: continue pressing or apply a special defense against the 4v3. When possession changes, one player from the team that loses possession exits the field, while one player from the team that gains the ball enters the field. Require players to: - pressure the ball - read both offensive and defensive orientation - control space - use concepts like delaying and floating - control space in shifting to advance in the game.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time goal counts.
