# Drill 2058

**Short description:**
Real 4v4 game + goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. Attack both goals when the centerline is crossed.

**Objectives:**
Improve the collective defensive aspects of defense during individual pressing to avoid the advancement of the game.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15 min.

**Number of players:**
8 + 2 G

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
Individual defense. Breaking out of pressing. If the ball crosses the halfway line with a ground pass or dribbling, attackers can target either of the two goals. If attackers switch to the other side with a high ball, they can attack the goal assigned to them before the attack began. The attack always starts from the goalkeeper of the team that has possession, and the ball must always cross the halfway line for the attack to be on both goals. The defensive goal is to prevent ball advancement by pressuring the ball through individual defense to prevent a controlled transition to the other side of the field. Insist on pressuring the ball while it travels by controlling the space between the defender and attacker, and by covering and controlling space as a fallback to prevent the advancement of play in case one defender is surpassed. Close off the opponent's passing lines with the ball, those that gain space through passes to a pivot or other key players.

**Variations:**
Only the first-strike goal counts, change the number of touches to your 1/2.
