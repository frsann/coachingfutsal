**Short description:**
Collective tactics â€“ Exiting the pressing

**Objectives:**
Organization of the game system when exiting pressing, with four players in the defensive zone.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 8 outfield players divided into two teams.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The action can start with the ball at the goalkeeper or from a throw-in. All outfield players must remain in the half where the ball is located. The team in possession of the ball must cross the midfield while controlling the ball. Once they have crossed into the opposing half, they can attack either goal. When the ball is recovered, it must be taken across the midfield to be able to attack either goal. The team that scores the most goals wins the challenge.

**Variations:**
To attack the goals, you can bypass the midfield with a pass to a teammate. Introduce touch limits on the ball.
