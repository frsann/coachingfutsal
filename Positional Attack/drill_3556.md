**Short description:**
Defense with substitutions. Real game on 20x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers.

**Objectives:**
Improving the defensive collective aspects of Defense with substitutions, individual foundations, group concepts for the development of individual defense with opponent substitutions based on game reading, developing basic concepts of perception - decision-making.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
Marked T-shirts, balls

**Progression:**
Group defensive principles for 3 players: switching marking, space control, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball. Real play on 20x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the team that scored will start the new attack. Create 2 teams of three players with substitutions. Pressure on the ball, switching marking, covering the counter defender, defensive orientation when pressing on the ball (center), space control when pressing on the ball, adjusting the first line of defense when an opposing player appears behind it on the side opposite the ball, working on defensive triangles. Intensity in ball pressure, reduce the distance from the player receiving the ball during its path. Quick positioning, preventing direct passing (goalkeeper to pivot). Individual position adjustment after goalkeeper throw-in. Retreating if the first line of defense is breached. Attention to perceptual concepts crucial for making decisions in defense: the ball is the reference point, defensive orientation, defensive orientation of the player marking an opponent with the ball.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time shot counts.
