# Drill 3680

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
By narrowing the field in this exercise and manipulating it to limit the last defender, the aim is for the coach and players to achieve the objective of the exercise itself: namely, to facilitate passing to the pivot and follow it up with supporting player movements.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the game is played on a 28x20 field to facilitate passes and support movements, with an increase in finalizations towards the goal. There are two teams of 3 players + 1 pivot when in possession of the ball, and 3 players + 1 defender when not in possession. The decisive rule is that the defender cannot leave the basketball painted area unless the pivot has first received the ball in a height space that does not exceed the 3-point area of the basketball court.
