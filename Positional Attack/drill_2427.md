# Drill 2427

**Short description:**
Three players (two flankers and a back) perform a sequence and pass the ball to the other trio that repeats the same.

**Objectives:**
Progress in the development of the attacking system 3-1.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
3 minutes after the sequence

**Number of players:**
6 per group

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
1. Sequence: The right fullback passes the ball to the last player and moves into the space between the lines. The last player passes the ball to the left fullback and spreads to the right. The left fullback passes the ball to the right fullback on a helping pass, and after receiving it back, controls it and plays it down to the "pivot."

2. Sequence: It is identical to Sequence 1: The right fullback passes the ball to the last player and moves into the space between the lines. The last player passes the ball to the left fullback and spreads to the right. The left fullback passes the ball to the right fullback on a helping pass, and after receiving it back, attempts to play it down to the "pivot." After failing, the ball is passed to the last player who has spread towards the sideline, and the ball received is played down along the line to the "pivot."

3. Sequence: It is identical to Sequence 2: The right fullback passes the ball to the last player and moves into the space between the lines. The last player passes the ball to the left fullback and spreads to the right. The left fullback passes the ball to the right fullback on a helping pass, and after receiving it back, attempts to play it down to the "pivot.” After failing, the ball is passed to the last player who has spread towards the sideline, and the ball received is attempted to be played down along the line to the "pivot.” After failing, the ball is returned to the player in the middle and a pass is made diagonally to the "pivot" behind the running teammate.

4. Sequence: The last player starts the action by passing the ball to one of the fullbacks and on the same side performs a "curtain" (running between the player with the ball and the opposing player who is marking, pressing him). The fullback controls the ball and switches sides to the other fullback who plays it down to the "pivot" after controlling or on the first touch.

5. Sequence: It is identical to Sequence 4: The last player starts the action by passing the ball to one of the fullbacks and on the same side performs a "curtain" (running between the player with the ball and the opposing player who is marking, pressing him). The fullback controls the ball and switches sides to the other fullback who cannot play it down to the "pivot" after controlling or on the first touch and returns it to the teammate who passed the ball to him, who then on the first touch plays it down to the pivot or switches the play for a pass to the pivot between the lines.

**Variations:**
Dropping from the first to the "pivot" is mandatory. Introduce passing with the heel and then dropping to the "pivot".

**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Positional Attack - Exit Pressing
