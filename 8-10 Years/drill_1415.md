Across the entire field, organize groups consisting of 4 players (two on each side, 12-18 meters apart) with one ball, facing each other (Diagram A). The red player passes the ball to the green player (1) who is in front of him on the other side, moves out (2) to receive a return pass (3) and executes a triangle (5) for the player who passed him the ball and runs for a one-two pass (4). The green player then passes the ball to the blue player (6). After this, there are no more passes to the player in front, but the players continue with triangles continuously as shown in diagram B.
