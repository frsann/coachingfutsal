**Progression:**
Arrange two rows of attackers on the side of the goal as shown in the picture. Three defensive players are positioned as follows: one inside the circle at the center, with the other two on the 10-meter mark, each on their respective halves. The attackers need to pass the ball to reach the other goal (where a goalkeeper defends) and score, while the defenders, who can only move sideways, try to prevent this by intercepting the passes.
