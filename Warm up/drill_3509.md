# Drill 3509

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Rondos are frequently used as actual tactical gyms, within which the team's group tactics are organized, trained, and improved. In this case, in the first instance, by training the pressure of the first line even in a basic sliding rondo, and in the second instance by adding the third defender, who should balance and act as a corrector for the pressure of the first defensive line.

**Area (mxm):**

**Progression:**
Didactically, in the first Rondo there is a situation of 4vs2 in each area of activity. The space is divided into two adjacent and equal fields. In the field opposite to where the 4vs2 takes place, an attacker always remains. The purpose of the attack is to move the ball to the other field, perhaps also implementing a one-touch pass against a pressing first defensive line, to pass the ball to the attacker on the other field. The vertical ball to the central support can be passed to the other field also directly, without relying on a lateral. In the second Rondo, a 3vs3 is played plus a central support. The space is always formed by two adjacent fields. On the field opposite to where the action takes place, another trio waits ready to play the 3vs3 + 1 when the ball changes fields. To change fields, the central support must be used, or the respective player on the opposite side can be approached. The ball can also be passed from one lateral to its counterpart on the same side, only if, before the pass, a wing pivot swap with the central player in the opposite field occurs.
