# Drill 3591

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Sylvio Rocha uses this activity in the first part of the warm-up to immediately immerse the players in the complexity of the game and especially to link it to what the theme of the session will be. If the session aims to have a focus on decision-making, creating advantages, and emphasizing the finishing phase, then choosing this type of activity for the warm-up is the right choice.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 3P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the game is played in surplus (5vs5) on a 40x20 field with 3 goalkeepers, as a goal is placed in the center of the field laterally. The thematic match is not complicated and involves few manipulations, precisely because the most important aspect, with the addition of a goal, is to find a way to create an advantage for refining and finalizing. The game is played with 2 touches and the finish is with 1 touch, as it is not the main objective. A goal can be scored in any of the 3 goals after making at least a minimum number of passes, which can be at the coach's discretion, knowing that a goal in the central goal is worth 2 points, creating a bit of competition in the match.
