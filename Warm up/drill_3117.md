# Drill 3117

**Short description:**
4+4+4

**Objectives:**
Warming

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
12 (or all players divided into 3 teams)

**Materials:**
Balls, vests

**Progression:**
We have 3 teams that pass the ball independently among their players from the first. When a coach calls one of the three teams, the other two must win their ball before all elements of the team in possession of the ball touch it. Once the action is over, we repeat the previous ball possession. In addition to paying attention to passing the ball, the goal is to improve the speed of pressing. All players must work together to execute the action as efficiently as possible.

**Variations:**
Vary the way you add.
