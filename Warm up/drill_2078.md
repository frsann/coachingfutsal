**Progression:**
Three teams composed of an equal number of players are arranged in a space bounded by a square, rectangle, or circle. In two of the three teams, each player has a ball and aims to keep it in their possession for a certain amount of time. The players without a ball try to win it from the opponents and keep it in their possession until the time runs out. Scoring method - points are earned if a player manages to keep the ball in their possession the entire time (1 point) or if a player wins it and retains it until the time expires (1 point).

**Variations:**
• Changing the play area. • Players can win the ball only from opponents. The team with more points wins. • Players without the ball attempt to gain possession and take it out of the playing field boundaries. If a player loses the ball, they can try to regain possession or assist teammates who have the ball. At the end of the game, the team that has taken more balls out of the playing field boundaries wins (1 point per ball). • Two teams play with several balls. Players from the same team can pass the ball to each other. The team starting without balls endeavors to gain and hold as many as possible in their possession. The team with more balls at the end of the game wins (1 point per ball).
