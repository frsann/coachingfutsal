All players

**Progression:**
Let's divide the teams (4v4, 5v5, 6v6) depending on the number of players. The game is played without a ball. The player with their hand in the air is the ball. The goal is to score by crossing the field line or entering the 6-meter zone. When the defender touches them, they become the ball. To pass the ball, you must say a teammate's name. At that moment, the teammate raises their hand and becomes the ball, and the player who said the name lowers their hand.

**Variations:**
At least 2 passes before scoring a goal. Play across the entire field using the 6m area as goals.
