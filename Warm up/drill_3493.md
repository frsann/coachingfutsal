# Drill 3493

**Short description:**
This type of activity in an initial phase of warming up can give the team the right warm-up to face the training session, especially by involving everyone in the Game, without resorting to out-of-context technical gestures, or with dry warming up, wasting precious time for those who have few training sessions available.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession in warm-up

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
Bet

**Materials:**
Small plates, balls

**Progression:**
Educationally, a 4vs4 game is played with an additional player who does not participate in the game, with two safe zones for each team arranged diagonally. The player who does not participate in the game remains stationary in one of the safe zones with a ball. If, during possession, a player manages to reach the opposite safe zone, they stay inside that zone, and the player who was previously stationary with the ball is freed, changing the direction of the game and moving the dynamics to another area.

**Variations:**
One variant could be not to limit the safe zones, meaning allowing one to stop in any safe zone to free the teammate with the other ball.
