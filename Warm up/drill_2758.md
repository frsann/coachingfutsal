We start with 2 hunters on the edges of an area measuring 20x10 m. Each hunter has a ball in hand, aiming to hit some of the players and turn them into hunters. A maximum of 4 balls for all hunters. The winner is the last player remaining in the game.

**Variations:**
- Change the size of the space.

- Change the part of the body that must be targeted (legs, for example).  
- If a player catches the ball, they gain an extra life.  
- Hunters can pass to each other before attempting a hit.
