**Progression:**
The activity is highly training from all points of view, as it manages to combine fundamental passing exercises with training the sub-principles of the offensive game model. Having a center that matches both rondos, and therefore a player whose dynamics and body orientation could make the rondo "incomplete" on one side for a moment, forces all players involved in ball possession to act differently. For example, providing support near the player opposite the center of the rondo; trying to let the center of the rondo play and thus make it indispensable as little as possible. On the other hand, the player who defends and tries to steal the ball will also have attitudes modified by the rules of the Rondo. She might, for example, decide not to cover the pass towards the center of the Rondo, in case it does not exist because the player engaged in possession is on the adjoining Rondo.
