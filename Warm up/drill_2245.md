**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
20x16

**Duration (min):**
10

**Number of players:**
8

**Materials:**
Ball, little Chinese cups

**Progression:**
Create 2 teams with an equal number of players. Divide the field into 2 equal areas, proportional to the number and quality of players (preferably 8, 12, or 16 for an equitable distribution of defenders). The objective is to maintain ball possession with all players in their designated half, against a set number of defenders, through a limited number of play periods (in the proposed example, we have a 4vs2 with possession limited to 2 touches). When the defenders gain possession of the ball, they must immediately attempt a pass in their possession area, avoiding the pressure from those who lost the ball. This simulates the initial phase of transition, where some try to prevent and others try to avoid an immediate counterattack. In case of a successful pass, the defenders will move to their possession area, as will those who will be the new defenders. As seen in the video, these will change whenever possession shifts to non-possession. The same will happen when the team in possession loses the ball due to an out-of-bounds pass or a control error.

**Variations:**
If we have a greater number of players, expand the field.
