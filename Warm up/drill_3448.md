**Short description:**
Ball possession with training of the first defensive lineSourceThe Futsal UFOP

**Objectives:**
This exercise is excellent for working on the aspect of the "opposite side" in Futsal.

In attack, you place more players and keep the ball on one side, attracting the defense to pressure, leaving the opposite side of the defense unprotected, creating a great space to attack.

In defense, this type of exercise is excellent for working on the coverage of the offensive triangle, often used in Y-shape defense as an example.

**Progression:**
Divide the playing space into two areas of the same size; The division of the players will be as follows: * Ball sector: Situation of 3x2; * Sector without the ball: Situation of 3x1; The attack must exchange passes among themselves, seeking to maintain possession of the ball for as long as possible; The attackers can move freely between spaces, always keeping 3 in each sector; The defense can only have 2 (two) defenders in the ball sector, with the isolated defender acting as cover; If the defense regains possession of the ball, it automatically becomes the attacker, while the trio that lost the ball begins to defend. VERSION with 8 players: The defense moves freely between sectors; If the defense regains possession of the ball, it automatically becomes the attacker, while the player who lost the ball and his teammate on the right begin to defend. VERSION with 11 players: If the defense regains possession of the ball, it automatically becomes the attacker, while the trio that lost the ball begins to defend.

**Variations:**
Variations: You can increase or decrease the playing area; You can limit the number of touches on the ball for the attack; You can define which sector each attacking trio will play in, without allowing them to swap sectors; You can allow more attackers to enter the area of the ball, with at least one (1) attacker staying in the opposite area; You can increase the number of defenders while always maintaining defensive coverage.
