**Short description:**
3 quartets in the middle of the field

**Objectives:**
Warm-up, ball possession, transition concept stimulation, decision making

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
There are 3 quartets, each with its own color and a ball, maintaining ball possession within the midfield square. The defender has the ball in hand. If the ball exits the midfield, is touched by the defender or another player from the other quartets, or a rule (touches, etc.) is not followed, the defender puts the ball they have in hand into play and resumes ball possession. Whoever lost it or committed an infraction must go retrieve the ball and can then start trying to defend - TRANSITION CONCEPT: if a player loses the ball, they must immediately try to recover it. Whoever recovers it must immediately take advantage of it (see PERFORMANCE LAB VIDEO from minute 57:00).

**Variations:**
- 2 touches - 1 touch alternated with 2 touches (if you receive it with the right foot, you must pass it with the left foot or vice versa) - if I pass with the right foot, I stop it with the left foot and vice versa (reading the foot for the defender)
