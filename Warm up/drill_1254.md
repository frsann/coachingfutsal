**Area (mxm):**
20x40

**Progression:**
Let's split the field into two longitudinal halves. Let's divide all the players into two teams plus 1, 2, or 3 jokers. If we have 13 players, for example, we make two teams of 5 players each plus 3 jokers. A maximum of two passes can be made on the same longitudinal side of the field; the third pass must go to the other side.

**Variations:**
There is no return ball. Goal from the first. Everyone to the attacking side of the field for the goal to count. The game is played with two touches (when the ball comes from the opponent, there's an extra touch).
