# Drill 103

**Short description:**
4 + 4 + 4, at the trainer's signal, two colors attack one with the goal of taking the ball from them.

**Objectives:**
Specific warm-up.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
12 (or all players divided into 3 teams)

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts.

**Progression:**
We have 3 teams that independently pass the ball among their players from the beginning. When the coach calls out one of the three teams, the other two must seize their ball before all the members of the team in possession have touched it. As soon as the action ends, we repeat the previous possession of the ball. Besides focusing on passing the ball, the aim is to improve pressing speed. All players must cooperate to carry out the most efficient action.

**Variations:**
Vary the method of addition.
