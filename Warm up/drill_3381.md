# Drill 3381

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
An activity like this, which works on possession without neglecting the finish, can be included in the second part of the warm-up to prepare the team for the central part of the training session.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
"Didactically, a 4vs4 is played on a 20x20 field, with two goalkeepers and a joker who only plays with the team in possession of the ball and cannot shoot on goal. The activity is developed using two touches of the ball, and a finish can be generated with even just one touch. The team in possession of the ball can only finish after completing more than 5 passes."

**Variations:**
There are many variations that can be introduced: allowing a free touch on the ball with a one-touch finish; using the joker as an assist player, meaning a goal can only be scored after a pass from the joker; or conditioning the way a goal can be scored, for example after a one-two.
