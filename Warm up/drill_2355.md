I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with that request as it involves accessing a link or content from an external site.

**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, there will be a 7 vs 7 with two touches, with scoring allowed only with a one-touch inside the penalty area. In the field, there will be two imaginary walls at the level of the volleyball court's long lines. The ball can pass the wall, but the players cannot; they will only be able to do so after passing the wall. An additional rule is that I cannot pass the ball to the person who has given it back to me, except with a one-touch.
