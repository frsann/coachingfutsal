# Drill 3596

**Short description:**
Ball possession/small-sided game seen during Cordoba Juvenil's training (minute 23:50)

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, playing between the lines, movement without the ball, reading the plays

**Area (mxm):**
9x12

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 o'clock

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Rondo with 3 players inside trying to intercept the ball. We give rules to those in possession outside—if a "pass leap" is made, the player who is "leaped over" must enter between the lines—if I enter between the lines and position myself, I stay until someone else enters in my place—when I leave the position between the lines, I occupy the position of the player who entered after me—after passing the ball, I must always enter between the lines unless I execute a "pass leap"—if I pass first-time (and the pass is successful), I can choose not to go between the lines. It’s played with two touches, but if I need more... I can take them. After each mistake, switch with one of the players who are defending. Evaluate other rules.
