**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, there will be a 7vs7 game with two touches, where the goal can only be scored with a single touch inside the penalty area. On the field, there will be two imaginary walls aligned with the long lines of the volleyball court. The ball can pass through the wall, but the players cannot, and they can only pass once they have crossed the wall. An additional rule is that I cannot pass the ball back to the person who passed it to me, except with a single touch.
