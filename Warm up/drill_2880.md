**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts

**Progression:**
Two teams. Using their hands, the players must pass the ball to each other. When receiving the ball, they must control it using a body part allowed in futsal (not hands), and then catch the ball. If the ball touches the ground, the team that did not touch the ball last receives it. Upon receiving, a player can take 2 steps. To score a goal, the ball must be thrown to the attacker, who uses their head to send the ball into the goal, which is not guarded by a goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
He cannot steal the ball, only intercept it. Introduce 2 balls. There is a goalkeeper and the goal must be scored from the first volley. For younger players, they do not need to control, but they can catch immediately.
