# Drill 799

**Short description:**
Warm-up drill "Ball in hand"

**Objectives:**
Warm-up

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8 minutes

**Number of players:**
12 players

**Materials:**
Balls, bibs

**Progression:**
- The game is played 5 vs 5 plus 2 goalkeepers, on a 40 x 20 field with three touches.- Each team has a player who holds a ball in hand (but can also play normally with their foot).- When a player says "ball" (it must be at the moment of control), the game continues with the ball of the attacking player who held it in hand.- For the goal to be valid with the new ball, there must be at least one pass (in addition, all players must cross the halfway line, and if the defenders do not retreat to the halfway line, the GOAL counts as double).

**Variations:**
- That the player carrying the ball in their hand can change direction. - That a goal can be scored directly, without having to make a pass. - That a goal from the back post has DOUBLE value.
