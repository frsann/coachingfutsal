**Progression:**
Inside a matrix, a game focused on ball possession is played, with 2 teams each composed of 4 players, depicted as the red and blue teams. In addition to these players, there are 3 jokers (shown in yellow in the diagram) who have a specific positioning on the field (reference zone, not static) and serve as support. Jokers A and C are positioned outside the square, on two opposite sides, and player B is positioned in the center of the matrix. As highlighted by the red dashed lines, this type of exercise with the particular arrangement of the jokers guarantees the realization of multiple triangulations, making players aware of their utility and facilitating their reading.
