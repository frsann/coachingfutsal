# Drill 2757

**Short description:**
Two teams are playing without a ball according to special rules.

**Objectives:**
Decision making, peripheral vision, player marking, entertainment.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on needs"

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Markers

**Progression:**
Let's divide the teams (4v4, 5v5, 6v6) depending on the number of players. The game is played without a ball. The player who has their hand in the air is the ball. The goal is to score by crossing the playing field line or entering the 6m area. When a defender touches them, they become the ball. To pass the ball, the player's name must be spoken. At that moment, the teammate raises their hand and becomes the ball, and the player who said the name lowers their hand.

**Variations:**
At least 2 passes before scoring a goal. Play across the entire field using the 6m area as goals.
