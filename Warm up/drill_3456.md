**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**

**Progression:**
Didactically, in this activity, you play 5vs5 or 6vs6 + 2 goalkeepers. Three small goals made out of cones are positioned at midfield. You can score in all the goals (main goal and small goals), and each goal is worth one point. If a goal in the main goal defended by the opposing goalkeeper is scored after having scored in one of the small goals, that goal is worth 2 points. Additionally, it will no longer be possible to score in the small goals each time you cross midfield or when the ball is stolen in the opponent's half.
