# Drill 3624

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The activity proposed by Checa can be seen as part of the final phase of the warm-up, which prepares the players for the intensity of the central phase of the training session, as it involves contact play, goalkeepers being engaged, intense finishing, and an evident manipulation of the Game.

**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 3P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the game is played simply 4vs4 with 3 goals placed at the center of the field, forming a triangle. In this proposal, the number of touches is limited when finalizing, but free touches could be allowed to facilitate how the shot is taken. A goal is valid only when it passes through two goals, so the goalkeeper must defend both outside and inside the goals to prevent the ball, after passing through the first goal, from also passing through the second.

**Variations:**
You can also play 5vs5 using the entire field as space, stating that there's no back pass except for a first-touch goal; the one who finishes can be given a maximum of 2 touches.
