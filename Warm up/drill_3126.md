**Duration (min):**
8

**Number of players:**
12

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Divide the team into 3 groups of 4, each of which will occupy one of the three squares that will form a triangle, spaced 5 meters apart from each other. The coach will assign each player in the group a number from 1 to 4. At his discretion, approximately every 10-15 seconds, he will call a number: the 3 called players (one from each group) must quickly run to the square on their right and intercept the ball against the other 3 from the other team. When everyone has intercepted the ball, they will return to their original squares. The game will be scored as follows: 2 points for those who grab the ball first, 1 point for those who grab it second, 0 points for those who grab it last (or with the ball outside the square).
