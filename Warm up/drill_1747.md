**Short description:**
Two teams are playing handball and trying to score more goals than the opponent.

**Objectives:**
Warm-up. Perception. Collaboration. Teamwork.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, branded T-shirts

**Progression:**
Organization - two teams play with equal or unequal numbers. There is no goalkeeper. Teams defend their goal and attempt to score on the other side by passing the ball with their hands and running with it. If the player with the ball is touched, they must pass the ball to a teammate. Swap players within the teams after each game. Teams can apply a specific formation on the field. A goal is scored by throwing the ball into the opponent's net. Keep in mind: • Players can pass the ball to a teammate through the air, by rolling it, or by bouncing it off the ground (a bounce pass). • Players attempt to regain possession of the ball by intercepting passes. • Game duration: 3 x 2 minutes.

**Variations:**
Changing the size of the playing field. If a player is touched while in possession of the ball, it goes to the opponents. A goal only counts if scored from outside the 6m area.
