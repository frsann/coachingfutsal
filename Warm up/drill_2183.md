**Objectives:**
Warm-up

**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
• Part 1 of Warm-up (15 min, on or off the field): Dynamic stretching, activating muscle fitness, and injury prevention exercises
• Part 2 of Warm-up (15 min): Passing exercise, practicing attack rotations related to the 4-0 attack system progressing end-to-end across the full width of the field. Goalkeepers with the goalkeeper coach at the other end.
• Field players in groups of 4, groups starting one after another from the boundary of the goalkeeper's practice area and returning outside the field.
• Subject matter (ways of progressing):
• Free progression with touch restrictions (2-1 touches), must use the full field width
• Four-player rotations:
• 4-0 rotation with side pairs: Position swaps on both sides from a cross pass. Pass through after a third short, two starting and securing the attack
• 4-0 rotation with diagonal runs: After three cross passes, pass to the side and two starting
• 4-0 rotation with two starts: Cross pass, back rotation, three-line, pass to the side, and two starting (see picture)
• 4-0 rotation standard: Progression with a break-through pass to a player given an auditory signal, for example, (a) forward run of the player who gave the supporting pass or (b) advance of the base player
• Free progression with touch restrictions: 2-1 touches
• Development: (a) setting defenders on the progression path, (b) finishing progression with scoring from the end quarter
• Key points:
• Use of the sole in directed ball controls, use of both feet, control -> taking along
• In attack rotations: (a) calm, easily readable movements by the player with the ball, (b) game position and visual control of the field: "don't turn your back on the ball" (c) reading the movements of the player without the ball
• Progressive intensification increase
