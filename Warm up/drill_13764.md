**Progression:**
The game is played as one-touch passes against two defenders in the middle. Whoever makes a mistake and the person who passed them the ball swaps places with them. Studs-up play is not allowed. A long ball can leave the circle but must be returned inside to continue counting. After 20 passes, the defenders stay inside once more. A tunnel means the defenders stay inside once more. If a player announces a tunnel, then the defenders stay inside twice. If the ball does not go out, counting continues from the moment the tunnel happened.
