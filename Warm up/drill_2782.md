# Drill 2782

**Short description:**
Futsal and handball are being played at the same time.

**Objectives:**
Warm-up, fun, ball possession, decision making.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on needs"

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, two benches.

**Progression:**
Let's split into two teams. Place two benches behind the sideline at the center on each side of the field (see the picture!). The game is played on a 40x20m field with two touches. Stealing is not considered a touch. If a player from the team in possession climbs onto the bench and receives a pass in his hands from his teammate, then his team can continue the attack with hands. A player can stay on the bench for only 5 seconds. A goal scored by hand is valid outside the 6m mark. A player holding the ball in his hand can keep it for a maximum of 2 seconds. If the ball drops from a player's hand, the team loses possession.

**Variations:**
Changing the number of touches. A goal by foot is only valid within 6m. All players must cross the center for the goal to count. If the defense does not return below the center, the goal is worth 2 points.
