# Drill 2476

**Short description:**
Two teams have a marked-off field where they operate with the ball, passing it with one touch. Each player will have a number, and when the coach calls out a number, the player from each team will invade the opposing team's field to try to take the ball, and the team in possession will use one touch to keep it. The exercise is presented as a challenge, and the team that scores the point is the one whose player returns to their field first, after stealing/disrupting the ball from the opponents. The team with the most points will win, while the other will suffer a penalty.
