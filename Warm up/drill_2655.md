# Drill 2655

**Short description:**
The task of the warm-up game "Ball in Hand"

**Objectives:**
Warm-up, decision making.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8 min

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
- The game is played 5v5 + 2G on a 40x20 field with 3 touches. - Each team has a player who holds the ball in their hand (but can also play normally with their feet). - When a player says "ball" (it must be at the moment of control), the game continues with the ball of the player who had it in their hand. - For a goal to be valid with the new ball, there must be at least one pass (also, all players must pass the midfield, and if the defenders do not retreat to their half, the GOAL counts double).

**Variations:**
- That a player carrying the ball in their hand can change the direction of the attack. - That a goal can be scored directly without requiring a pass beforehand. - That a goal scored on the far post counts as DOUBLE.
