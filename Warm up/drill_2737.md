**Progression:**
Using the full court (40x20) put two lines in each half at the 10m mark going across the court. Divide the players into two teams. Each team has their own half and has 5 balls behind their line. To win the team needs to get all 10 balls behind their line at the same time or whoever has the most balls when the coach ends the exercises.To steal a ball from the opponent a player must go into the other half and take a ball and run back and put it behind their line. They can only take 1 ball at a time. If they are tagged (touched) by the other team while in their opponent’s half (whether with or without a ball) they must return to their own half without a ball. They cannot be tagged while in their own half or behind the opponent’s line.
