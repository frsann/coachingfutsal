**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
2 teams of 4 players plus goalkeepers plus 1 pivot per team - pivot with the ball in hand playing beyond the area delimited by cones - the pass to the pivot can only be made after crossing the midfield - only after the pivot has received the ball can the defenders enter the pivot's area - the pivot plays with 2 touches, after the pivot has received the ball it is man-to-man defense - if the pivot kicks the game ball out and plays the ball that is in hand, the pivot's team automatically attacks the other goal.

**Variations:**
variant 1: only the pivot moves forward in the first variant 2: only the player who moves to the pivot and their defender enter the scoring zone variant 3: all players must be in the offensive half (except the other pivot) for the goal to be valid, otherwise, the goal counts double.
