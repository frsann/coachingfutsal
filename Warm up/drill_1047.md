The game starts with a player outside the field with the ball. The players of both teams position themselves according to the arrangement in the diagram. The external player passes the ball to a teammate, and the 4 vs 4 situation begins. The players can attack both goals. Upon turnover, both goals can be attacked. If the ball goes out of play (e.g., corner, sideline, etc.), the coach introduces a new ball. The situation ends when a goal is scored, or the ball goes out of play three times. At the end: the defending team rests; the reserve team attacks; the attacking team defends. The challenge is won by the team that scores the most goals.
