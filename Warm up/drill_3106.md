**Short description:**
4 + 4 + 4, on the coach's signal two colors attack one with the goal of taking the ball from them.

Specific warm-up.

40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
12 (or all players divided into 3 teams)

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts.

**Progression:**
We have 3 teams that independently pass the ball among their players from the start. When the coach calls out one of the three teams, the other two must take possession of their ball before all the members of the team in possession touch it. As soon as the action ends, we repeat the previous ball possession. Besides paying attention to passing the ball, the goal is to improve the speed of pressuring. All players must cooperate to execute the most effective action.
