**Progression:**
The first group positions itself in a classic 3-1 formation. The center starts the exercise by passing to the right winger. The right winger, upon receiving the ball, observes the movement of the pivot on his side and, if the play allows, makes a pass to him. If the passing line is blocked, he observes the movement of the center, who gains ground with a central drive towards the area near the free throw line. If this option is also not possible, the right winger moves inward and takes the place of the center who has moved forward. Once reaching the central area, the right winger exchanges with the left winger or turns and passes to the pivot, who in the meantime has covered and taken the position left by the right winger. Thus, we will have the pivot becoming the right winger, the center becoming the pivot, and the right winger becoming the center. The process starts over again.
