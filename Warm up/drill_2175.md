**Objectives:**
Warm-up

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
30

**Number of players:**
All the players

**Materials:**
Bibs, balls

**Progression:**
• Part 1 of the warm-up (15 min, on or off the field): Non-ball warm-up, dynamic stretching, activating muscle exercises, and injury-preventive exercises. All players together. • Part 2 of the warm-up (15 min): Passing in groups of three around the field: reviewing ball-handling techniques and strengthening passing accuracy to a moving player. Goalkeepers with the goalkeeper coach at the other end. Topics for progressive passing drills, for example: • Two touches, controlled reception with the sole and pass • Two touches, always changing lanes with controlled reception, to which others must respond • Advancing bottom-eight rotation, with or without a helping pass • Advancing bottom-eight rotation, diagonal pass after front rotation and side change • Three-player rotation of futsal national teams, progressing with a diagonal pass after a helping pass • Back rotation and diagonal pass after side change • Free mode of progression, decreasing touches: 2, 1.5, and 1 touch • Free mode of progression and bypassing defenders (see development form below) Development: • Use of field space: If space outside the field is available for the exercise at Eerikkilä sports hall, the passing exercise is expanded to this area and possibly conducted in two groups of 10 players. • After 8-10 min of passing, constricted defenders (2-4 pcs) join the rotation route. Losing the ball results in becoming a defender. Possible constraints: defenders may only defend forward, defenders have a limited activity area on the route, defenders may only move by jogging. Key points: • Use of the sole in controlled receptions, use of both feet, reception -> involvement • Feints and observing teammates' movements to identify the right moment for a pass • In attack rotation exercises, calm movements that are easily readable by the ball holder • Increasing intensity toward the end of the warm-up
