# Drill 3258

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
With a view to a warm-up that, after the first few minutes where players activate individually or the fitness trainer proposes prevention work, brings the player immediately into the Game and its dynamics, there's nothing better than taking inspiration and stimuli from the activities proposed by Daniel Rodriguez.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Progression:**
Educationally, in this activity, players start from a line at the halfway corner, shooting towards the goal in a non-intensive manner since this activity takes place at the beginning of the session. The same player will attempt to intercept the goalkeeper's throw or kick, depending on the coach's choice, which the goalkeeper will try to send to a pivot already positioned in the other half of the field or to a player entering from the opposite halfway corner. If the pivot receives, they must make a one-touch pass to the incoming player, who must then shoot in one touch; if the incoming player receives, they will finish themselves. Rotation involves the player attempting to intercept the launch joining the incoming player's line; the player who entered will stay in the pivot position, while the pivot will join the line to attempt an intercept. In this way, in this activity at the beginning of the warm-up, we start warming up the shots on goal, primary collaboration with a pivot, and shooting while receiving a long pass, especially focusing on two types of goalkeeper throws: a transition one and one to the pivot.
