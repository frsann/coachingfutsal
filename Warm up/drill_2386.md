**Progression:**
Within a matrix, a game centered on ball possession is played, involving 2 teams of 4 players each, illustrated as the red and blue teams. In addition to these players, there are 3 jokers (yellow in the illustration) who occupy specific positions on the field (reference zones, not static) and act as support. Jokers A and C are positioned outside the square on the two opposite sides, and player B is positioned at the center of the matrix. As highlighted with red dashed lines, this type of exercise with the particular arrangement of the jokers ensures the creation of multiple triangulations, providing awareness of their utility and facilitating players' understanding.
