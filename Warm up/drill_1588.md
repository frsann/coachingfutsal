# Drill 1588

**Short description:**
Individual tactics - warm-up

**Objectives:**
Warm-up and neuromuscular activation.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8 to 15

**Number of players:**
All the players divided into 3 teams.

**Materials:**
Vests to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The players are divided into 3 groups, which can vary depending on the number of players, and they operate in one half of the field (20x20 meters). At the start, one player from each group is the hunter while the others are hares. The hunter must try to catch the hares from their group by touching them. The hares can only escape within the playing rectangle. Each hare that is caught becomes a hunter. The prey must join the hunter by holding hands to form a chain. In this condition, they must attempt to catch the remaining hares. With the capture of a new prey, the chain lengthens (from 1 to 2, 3, 4, etc.). If during the hunt the chain breaks, the hunters cannot capture the hares until the chain is restored. The game ends when all the hares have been caught.

**Variations:**
A single group can also be formed. To make the movements more complex, each player must hold a ball with both hands (the chain will be formed by linking arms).
