**Progression:**
The game is played with one-touch passes against two defenders in the middle. Whoever makes a mistake, along with the person who passed to them, goes in the middle. No playing with dangerous tackles allowed. A long pass can go outside the circle but must be returned to the circle for the counting to continue. If there are 20 passes, the defenders stay in the middle once more. A tunnel situation means the defenders stay once more. If a player calls for a tunnel, then the defenders stay in twice. If the ball doesn't go outside, the counting continues from the moment the tunnel happened.
