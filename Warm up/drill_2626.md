# Drill 2626

**Short description:**
Two teams have a defined field where they play with the ball, passing it with one touch. Each player will have a number, and when the coach calls a number, the player from each team will invade the opponent's field to try to take the ball, and the team in possession will use one touch to keep it.

**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
18x9 (volleyball court)

**Duration (min):**
10'

**Number of players:**
10 minimum (preferably even)

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The exercise presents itself as a challenge, and so the team that scores a point is the one whose player returns first to their field after having stolen/deflected the ball from the opponents. The team that scores the most points will win, while the other will suffer a penalty.

**Variations:**
If I have a good number of players, I can also call 2 numbers at a time. In that case, the players in possession have 2 touches.
