**Progression:**
Organization - two teams play with an unequal number of players. The team of players (color) who are the chasers have a set amount of time to collect a certain number of points by tagging "opponents." Players can work alone or with a teammate to try to achieve a score. The fleeing players can carry a ball (3 seconds) which protects them from the chasers (they cannot be caught while holding the ball). Change the chaser team after each time period. Scoring method - players are awarded points after they catch and tag an opponent on the body between the shoulders and waist. Keep in mind: • 5 trios are involved in the game - 4 trios each have a ball, and one trio is chasing. • Players try to save a teammate by passing them the ball before being tagged by a chaser, leaving the ball on the ground for them to pick up to save themselves from the chasers, or by escaping from the chaser. • Change the team that chases after a certain period. • Organize players into teams (minimum of three players per team) • Duration - 15-30 seconds • General requirements - achieve the goal, improve the goal, achieve a better initial result.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the play area.
