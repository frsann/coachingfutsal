**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Peripheral vision, attentional capacity, anticipation, communication, and body orientation.

**Area (mxm):**
3x6

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8/9/10

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
FIGURE 1 (9 players): Didactically, there are two rondos, composed on two adjacent squares (rectangles). The game is played with one-touch and a player positioned on the shared side between the two rectangles must play with both rondos. (obviously, two balls are used simultaneously.)

FIGURE 2 (8 players): Again, two adjacent rectangles, but instead of being on the sides, players position themselves at the vertices. In this case, the players who play with both rectangles are 2.

**Variations:**
RECCHIA/CASTELLANA VARIANT (10 players): use two players inside the squares that defend (simulating a two-player first line) within the square with marking/covering tasks. The objectives are obviously different, but I am sharing it for discussion. In this case, however, the red team plays with only one ball, and the six players must pass the ball to each other, overcoming the defensive line of the two blue players in each square to train the first defensive line. Give freedom to the two RED players (2 and 3) to also move on the line dividing the two squares. Upon the blue players gaining possession of the ball, the two red players in the center, in turn, intercept the pass with the other two blue players placed in the opposite square to permanently recover possession.
