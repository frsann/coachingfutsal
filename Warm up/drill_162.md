# Drill 162

**Short description:**
The resistance of this exercise aims to improve aerobic efficiency at an intensity of 65% of the heart rate reserve, and it is a perfectly valid foundation exercise. It is integrated within the global context of the game, where aspects such as perception, decision-making, and execution are developed simultaneously.

**Objectives:**
Aerobic efficiency / improving supports, passing line and spatial organization, rotations.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20 meters

**Duration (min):**
workout: 3 sets of 5' (15')/ Recovery 3 sets of 2'

**Number of players:**
12 players

**Materials:**
3 groups of 4 spots of different colors. 4 blue, 4 green, 4 red. 12 balls

**Progression:**
Description: Maintain ball possession (8 x 4) 3 groups of 4 players, each group will be called with a letter (A, B, C): 1st series groups: "A" and "B" try to maintain ball possession in half the field, while group "C" tries to steal the ball for 5'. 1st series: 2' active recovery: abdominal exercises or passive recovery: stretches. 2nd series groups: "A" and "C" try to maintain ball possession in half the field, while group "B" tries to steal the ball for 5'. 2nd series: 2' active recovery: abdominal exercises or passive recovery: stretches. 3rd series groups: "C" and "B" try to maintain ball possession in half the field, while group "A" tries to steal the ball for 5'. 3rd series: 2' active recovery: abdominal exercises or passive recovery: stretches.

**Variations:**
Requiring players to have a minimum number of touches would increase the intensity, so we must be aware that we may need to reduce the duration of the sets to stay within the proposed conditional objective. Additionally, all cognitive processes would become more complex due to having less time for perception, decision, and execution.
