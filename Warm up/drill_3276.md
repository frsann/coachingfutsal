**Progression:**
Didactically, players are divided into two teams of seven with three jokers who always play with the team in possession of the ball. The objective is to maintain possession throughout the available field, having a ball in hand. The player who receives a pass from their teammate must leave the ball they have on the floor in order to play it with their feet and take the one that has been passed to their hands. If the ball that arrives from a pass is stopped with the feet, possession switches to the other team, as well as in all situations that do not show adherence to the game's rules. In collective playful games before a training session, principles and concepts that will be trained later must always be included, and above all, they must foresee manipulations that also serve to improve the player. Always.
