# Drill 1982

**Short description:**
Warming up through possession play, a player is active if they get rid of the marker vest, throwing it onto the ground.

**Objectives:**
Warming.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Marked jerseys, balls, caps (small cones)

**Progression:**
- We divide the players into two teams with goalkeepers. 
- The game is played on the entire field (40x20). 
- Each player holds a marking shirt or cap (mini cone). 
- Unlimited number of touches. 
- Every attacker who touches the ball throws the marking shirt or cap (mini cone) on the ground and is thus activated to score a goal (only on the first attempt within 6m). 
- When attackers lose possession of the ball, to play defense, they must pick up a marking shirt or cap (mini cone).

**Variations:**
- Players must pick up the same marker shirt or cap (mini cone) they previously threw on the ground.
- A goal can be scored from any part of the field.
- Limit the game to two touches.
