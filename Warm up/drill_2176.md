**Progression:**
Exercise: Continuous 3vs3/4vs4 Attacks Organization: • 2 teams of 10 field players each. Goalkeepers are included in the teams and each team has a coach to guide the game. • Playing area 32-40 x 20 m. While one trio is on the field (e.g., red), other trios (e.g., pink) wait ready for their turn to attack at three points outside the field. • When the attacking trio loses the ball, they immediately switch to defense, with the goal of reclaiming ball possession for their team. If the defending trio gains possession, they immediately initiate a new attack by passing the ball to their trio waiting outside the field for their turn. After this, the trio switches out. • Rotation of exercise: attack -> defense -> switch Development variations: • Same exercise with 4vs4 attacks (8-10 min) • Additional goalkeepers or coaches at ends to provide balls to playing goalkeepers to expedite transitions Key points or questions (focusing on defensive play): • No delay in transition from attack to defense • Actions after losing the ball: • Immediate pressure by the defender closest to the ball on the player with the ball, and closing passing lanes to depth • Delaying and retreating • Reorganizing the defense: pressure, support, securing, and controlling the empty space behind • Organized defense and press-playing • How to delay the opponent's attack? Where to retreat? What to do after retreating? • When is it advisable to attack quickly, and when slowly?
