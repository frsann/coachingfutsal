**Progression:**
Inside the half field, there are two goals, each defended by a goalkeeper. Four players are placed on each corner of the square, and one in the center. The players at the corners pass the ball to each other, with two predetermined touches; at their discretion, a player passes the ball to the teammate in the center. The center player must finish towards the goal opposite from where they received the ball, evading the marking of the player diagonally in relation to where the ball started. After the action, if the attacker scores, they remain in the center; if not, they switch positions with the defender.
