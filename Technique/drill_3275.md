**Short description:**
work on 1vs1 coverage from the side

**Objectives:**
Goalkeeper or central defender coverage

**Area (mxm):**
34x20

**Duration (min):**
3

**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
A 10-meter area is marked where the pivot and the central player will be. A 2vs2 game is played where you should try to achieve a 1vs1 on the side. The pivot should tend to stay diagonally in relation to the 1vs1. Based on our defensive norms, you can choose whether to have the central player move out and have the weak side lateral scale, or have the goalkeeper move out while the central player remains with the pivot.

**Variations:**
You can also afford the down-the-line shot if we manage to switch sides quickly.
