The purpose of the attackers is to score the goal, for the defender and the goalkeeper to prevent it. Attacker 1 with the ball positions themselves on the cone closest to the goal; the defender B, on the intermediate one, but with their back to the ball; attacker 2 without the ball, on the farthest cone. Attacker 2 must shoot the ball into the goal after receiving it from their teammate; the defender tries to prevent it, but they can only start their defensive action when attacker 2 makes the first move or when the ball enters their field of vision.
