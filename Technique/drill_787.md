# Drill 787

**Short description:**
Individual tactics

**Objectives:**
Pass time on lateral release clearance.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 15'

**Number of players:**
4 players: 1 goalkeeper, 1 defender, and 2 forwards

**Materials:**
1 ball.

**Progression:**
The attacker on the wing moves along the line, then abruptly changes direction towards the center of the field (release). The other attacker positions themselves in the center of the field, ready to pass the ball when their teammate gets open. The defender must mark the attacker on the wing and can only start defending when the attacker changes direction. The defender is required, until they start defending, to not look at the ball (they must turn their back).

**Variations:**
After completing the action, you can attack the opposite goal with reversed roles.
