# Drill 113

**Short description:**
1v1 on small goals, in 6 sections of the field.

**Objectives:**
1vs1.

**Area (mxm):**
10x10

**Duration (min):**
14 minutes (20'' work, 20'' rest; two sets of 5 minutes with a 4-minute break in between)

**Number of players:**
16 maximum

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the field into 8 equal parts where a 1v1 game is played. Player No. 1 passes the ball to Player No. 2 and then goes to play defense. Each player performs one action and then they switch roles. The exercise always starts in the same way and lasts 20 seconds. The rest period is equal to the exercise duration, i.e., 20 seconds. One series lasts 5 minutes. We perform 2 series with a 4-minute break in between. The attacking player can score on either of the two small goals. The exercise duration of 20 seconds and incomplete rest surely initiate anaerobic mechanisms.

**Variations:**
A player who attacks must dribble past the opposing player before scoring a goal, and in the next play, they can score without dribbling him again.
