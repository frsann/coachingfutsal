**Progression:**
1vs1 challenges lasting 1 minute with 4 supports: 2 supports in the middle of the field (2-meter range) playing with 2 touches and 2 pivot supports that can move across the entire backfield. The supports can pass the ball to each other and the defense must always adapt their position at the ball level. If the ball is intercepted, I shouldnâ€™t turn but should watch my man. If the ball goes out to the lateral support and my man goes beyond the ball line, I should move up to the line. If my man has the ball beyond the support and passes it to the support, he must lower himself to the ball line. LATERAL SUPPORTS (2 TOUCHES AND ABOVE) PIVOT SUPPORTS (MAX 2 TOUCHES).

**Variations:**
2vs2 challenges last 90 seconds, 3vs3 challenges last 2 minutes.
