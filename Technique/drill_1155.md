**Progression:**
It's a 4 vs. 2 game with three colors (2 colors attack, 1 color defends). The game is played with a two-touch limit on the ball, and a shot on goal must be made within 6 passes. The shot on goal must be made with the first touch. Role change: when the defenders touch the ball twice consecutively, or the ball goes out of bounds. The color that last touched the ball becomes the defender. Upon recovering the ball, the opposite goal to the previous one is attacked. POINTS OF FOCUS: Move the ball quickly and aim for the goal as soon as there's an opportunity.
