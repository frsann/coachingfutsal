# Drill 2809

**Short description:**
3 stations to the finish line at the goal.

**Objectives:**
Improve the action for the finish and enhance the shot.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
Let's make 3 stations as in the images below. Divide the players into 3 groups + 1 passer. After a certain time, switch the sides of the cone. 1) Pass to the passer between two cones + fake movement to hide from the defender's view + sudden move in front of the defender while he is watching the ball + receiving with the sole in motion in front of oneself + shot on goal. (Schumi) 2) Pass to the passer + fake movement + change of direction to a parallel + shot on goal or pass to the far post. (Parallel) 3) Pass to the passer + fake lateral movement + move in front of the defender + receive in motion + strike on goal. (Pivot receiving)

**Variations:**
We can include any specific futsal action (diagonal, 1v1, block...). Position the player at the second post.
