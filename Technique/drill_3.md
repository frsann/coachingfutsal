# Drill 3

**Short description:**
20x20, 1vs1, the attacker becomes the defender, a new attacker comes in ...

**Objectives:**
Finalization, 1v1.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
All players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
We start with one defensive player and one forward player at the center of the field. The forward tries to shake off the defender with a feint and receive a pass from one player (selected from) the corner to complete the play immediately. Right after the shot, the forward becomes the defender and tries to prevent the passer, who has become the attacker, from freely shooting at the goal and so on...

**Variations:**
The player from the corner only moves when the attacker touches the ball, meaning takes a shot at the goal. If the attacker scores a goal, they continue attacking until they miss.
