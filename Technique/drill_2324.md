**Progression:**
On the sidelines, place two cones on each side about 5 meters away from the centerline (the distances can be adjusted if you want more 2vs1 or more 2vs2 scenarios). Then, divide the field vertically from the attackers' starting line up to the 10-meter defensive line. The exercise is carried out towards one goal only. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the two attackers, who is faced by the player standing on the marker placed in the defensive position on the same side. Once the player in possession receives the ball, they can decide to cross the halfway line, in which case it will be a 1vs1 in a quarter of the field, or they can pass the ball to the player diagonally opposite them on the other side, activating a 2vs1 scenario where the other player, who is on the receiver's side, must chase to try to re-establish numerical equality.
