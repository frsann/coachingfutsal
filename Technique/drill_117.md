**Number of players:**
All players.

**Materials:**
Balls, cones.

**Progression:**
Player No. 8 (and the next one in his column) passes the ball to player No. 3, who frees himself from an imaginary direct follower with a feint before receiving the ball. Player No. 3 passes the ball to the player from whom he received it. He tries to pass the ball to the beginning of the square so that the player controlling it has more time to prepare a shot. Player No. 8 makes a feint and runs into the square, where he receives the ball with his instep and shoots at the goal before it exits the square.

**Variations:**
We work on both sides, changing goalkeepers and passers.
