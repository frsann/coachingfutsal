**Objectives:**
Passing in game situation - Quickness of passing.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 20'

**Number of players:**
9 players: divided into 3 teams, each distinguished by a color.

**Materials:**
2 balls. Bibs: to define the teams.

**Progression:**
A 6 versus 3 game is played to maintain ball possession. It is played with a limit of 2 touches per ball. Two teams of different colors attack and the team of the third color defends. Role changes occur when the defending team intercepts the ball or sends the ball out of the playing perimeter. On a change of possession, play resumes with the ball that was in the hands of a defender. The team of the color that last touched the ball goes to defend, and to intercept the ball, a defender must have the ball that was in play in hand.

**Variations:**
After 20 consecutive passes, you remain on defense for one more turn. The second round is played with 1 touch, with 15 passes, doubling the round.
