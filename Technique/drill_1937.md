# Drill 1937

**Short description:**
1v1 on 3 zones without a goalkeeper

**Objectives:**
Basics of individual technique in defense and attack.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide into 2 teams. Determine pairs for 1v1. Divide the field into 3 zones as shown in the picture. Two end zones of 10m and a central zone of 20m. In the end zones, active 1v1 defense is played, and in the central zone, there is no ball-taking. The winner is the team that scores more goals. Encourage players to use peripheral vision and observe how they can use teammates' blocks for successful dribbling.

**Variations:**
We can impose penalties for the losing team. We can change the zones where active defense is played.
