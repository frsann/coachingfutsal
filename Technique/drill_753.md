# Drill 753

**Short description:**
Individual technique

**Objectives:**
Transmission of the ball in sync with the players' movements.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5 to 15 minutes

**Number of players:**
4 players: positioned at each corner of the square.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Cones: to define the square (10x10 meters).

**Progression:**
Player 1 passes the ball down the line to teammate 4, who then sends the ball diagonally to teammate 2. As soon as the ball is passed, 1 switches positions with the diagonal teammate (in this case 3). When 2 receives the ball, they pass it down the line to 1, who in turn passes it diagonally to the teammate. Meanwhile, 2 and 4 switch positions. Following this sequence, the exercise continues without interruptions. The players' position switches within the square must be in sync with the speed of the ball's transmission.

**Variations:**
Depending on the limit of touches each player has available, we will have a different athletic goal: Players playing with 2 touches: we will have an exercise aimed at training aerobic endurance. Players playing with 1 touch: they will train speed endurance.
