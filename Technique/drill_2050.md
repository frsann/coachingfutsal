# Drill 2050

**Short description:**
Mark the space and give each player a ball.

**Objectives:**
Ball control and retention.

**Area (mxm):**
10x10

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, pins

**Progression:**
Make a square with all the players inside with a ball. The aim of the game is to protect your ball and kick other players' balls out of the square. If a player's ball goes out of the square, they are out and must leave the square. The last player with a ball inside the square wins.

**Variations:**
Allow players whose ball has been taken out to return as defenders (i.e., without a ball). Place balls around the square, with one less than the number of players. At the coach's call, each player finds a ball. A player without a ball tries to steal someone else's. The player without a ball at the end of the time limit (e.g., 20 seconds) loses.
