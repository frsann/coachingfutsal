# Drill 3615

**Short description:**
Supplier, attacker and defender.

**Objectives:**
Marking players without the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
7x10m

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on the needs"

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
Basic rules: - The attacker earns 1 point each time they clearly receive the ball - The defender earns 1 point each time they intercept the ball controllably using the foot sole - If the ball is not properly controlled by either the defender or the attacker, no points are awarded - Once one of the two controls the ball, the other cannot react, and the ball is returned to the passer The attacker and defender face off in an area approximately 7x10m, and they cannot leave this area. During a set time, the attacker plays with the passer and tries to receive the most passes, while the defender tries to anticipate and prevent the opponent from receiving the ball. The roles of attacker and defender are swapped at intervals, and points are tallied to determine the winner. Roles rotate so that three players participate in 3 scenarios (passer, attacker, and defender) Time: 2 x 2'-3'

**Variations:**
We have two players making passes with two touches, provoking changes in defensive orientation. (image 263) We have one passer moving along the line in both directions, provoking changes in defensive orientation. (image 267)
