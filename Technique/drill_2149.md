**Progression:**
Two teams play with jokers who are moving in the zone near the goal line. The players are divided as follows: On the large part of the field, it's a 4v4 game, with goalkeepers on the goals. In the zones for the jokers, there are two players from each side. Defensive players cannot enter the zone where the jokers are. The team in possession of the ball can shoot without connecting with the jokers or by connecting with them through passing. The jokers cannot strike, meaning they have to return the ball to their teammates who then look for a shot on goal. On the coach's signal, rotate players by position.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players. Only a first-time goal counts. Jokers can take a shot.
