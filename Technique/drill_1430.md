**Progression:**
Players compete in pairs simultaneously. One is opposite the other where one is an attacker and the other a defender. The defender passes the ball to the attacker, who must control it within a designated area (square, circle) and then dribble past the defender within a designated area. After that, the attacker plays defense, and the defender positions themselves to control the ball and attack.

**Variations:**
Vary the type of passing (by hand, foot, high, on the ground, etc.) and the method of control (chest, foot, knee). Time-limit the attack. Change the width of the line that the player defends.
