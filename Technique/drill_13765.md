10

**Number of players:**
At least 10 players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones, markers.

**Progression:**
The game starts by adding a player with the ball to up to four players on the opposite side (see the picture). The passer must pass the ball across the court between defenders who stand in a line at a distance of about 5 meters. Defenders can intercept the ball and attack one of the goals. If the ball reaches the attackers, they can attack one of the goals. If the attackers score a goal, they continue attacking; otherwise, they become the defense.

**Variations:**
Attackers can change the direction of attack once. Attackers can change the direction of attack multiple times. Attackers can only attack the goal in the half where the ball was received. After the attack, activate a counterattack on the other side. Start the game with 3 attackers and one passer on a 28x20m field.
