# Drill 1098

**Short description:**
FUTSAL - TECHNICAL FUNDAMENTALS WITH THE BALL - Authors - Roberto Osimani and Mico Martic

**Objectives:**
Ball dribbling: with protection.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
At least 6 players: 30% hunters, 70% prey.

**Materials:**
One ball for each player. Cones: form a rectangle proportional to the number of players.

**Progression:**
All players dribble the ball within the rectangle; at the coach's signal, they must dribble the ball at maximum speed to the rectangle in front. In this example, the last two players to arrive become hunters. When the hunter hits the prey's ball with their own, the prey becomes the hunter. The prey cannot: 1) leave the field of play; 2) lift the ball. Once all the prey are caught, the game starts again. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Players must always remain in motion.

**Variations:**
The exercise can be performed, even using both penalty areas.
