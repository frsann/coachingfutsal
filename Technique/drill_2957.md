We organize the players as shown in the picture depending on the number of players in training. The action starts with blue 5 moving toward the center of the field. When in the middle, they receive a pass from blue 2 and then turn the play to blue 3. They continue moving toward blue 4 and stand in line behind them. After that, red 3 moves toward the center of the field, receives the ball from red 2, and turns the play to red 5. They continue moving toward red 4 and stand in line behind them, etc. It is important to explain the technique of receiving the ball to the players (you can see in the video clip below).
