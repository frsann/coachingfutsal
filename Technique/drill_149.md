# Drill 149

**Short description:**
Individual tactics

**Objectives:**
Attack: shooting, dribbling, and ball control. Defense: goalkeeping.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20. Inside the field, two technical areas are distinguished by the 9 m line of the handball; in the absence of this, they will be formed with cones.

**Duration (min):**
1 repetition 3'/4'. 1 set: from 2 to 4 repetitions.

**Number of players:**
The players are divided into two teams of equal number, distinguished by jerseys, e.g., 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, etc.

**Materials:**
1 ball, each pair. Bibs to define the roles of the pair. Cones: to define the area where you can finish at the net, 8/9 meters from the baseline.

**Progression:**
The aim of the exercise is for the player in possession of the ball to score a goal by shooting the ball into the opponent's goal. The shot on goal must be along the ground. Conversely, the player not in possession of the ball must prevent the goal from being scored by positioning themselves on the shooting line. Outside the technical area, the defender can only intercept the ball, while inside they can also challenge the attacker. The challenge is won by the one who scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
The defender's leg mobility must maintain balance and constantly block the shot.
