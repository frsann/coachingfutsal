**Number of players:**
8 players: divided into 2 teams.

2 balls. Bibs: to define the teams.

**Progression:**
In one half of the field, a 4 versus 2 game is played; the objective: to maintain possession of the ball. The remaining 2 players stay in the other half of the field. When the 2 defenders intercept the ball, they play the ball they have in hand and pass it to their teammates on the other field. The last 2 who touched the ball become defenders: one picks up the ball in hand and then they move to the other half of the field, restarting the 4 versus 2.

**Variations:**
The defender does not have the ball in hand, only one ball is being played with.
