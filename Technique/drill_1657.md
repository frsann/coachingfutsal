# Drill 1657

**Short description:**
Individual Tactics

**Objectives:**
Defensive and offensive concepts in 1v1. Effective space searching by the defender. Attacking the defender's weak point for the attacker.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 15'

**Number of players:**
9 players: 6 forwards each with 1 ball, 3 defenders.

**Materials:**
Cones: to define a 20x20 meter playing rectangle, to form an equilateral triangle with 3-meter sides. 1 ball per attacker, bibs to define the defenders.

**Progression:**
3 defenders: each defends a goal represented by the side of the triangle at the center of the field. The attackers aim to surpass the defender 1v1 and lead the ball into the square. The defender who scores the most points wins: 2 points for recovering the ball, 1 point for clearing it. The attacker who scores the most goals wins.

**Variations:**
Vary the size of the field, the central geometric figure, the goal can also be scored with a low shot inside the goal (this trains the defender's ability to defend the goal).
