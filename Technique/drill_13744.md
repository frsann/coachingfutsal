# Drill 13744

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
A great activity to use in the last part of the warm-up, right before diving into the core of the training session, especially if the session's theme is defensive, involving not only primary defensive collaborations, which helps players to immediately engage with the theme they are about to tackle.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Tactically, a 2 vs 2 is played on half the field with 2 neutral players positioned at the back of the field, exactly placed between the edge of the penalty area and the corner kick spot (this to ensure a reasonable distance from the goal). The task of the two attackers is to connect with one of the two neutral players, while the defense's task is to make this connection difficult or to direct the connection towards a side that allows for an easy rebalancing or an easy defensive rotation. Yes, because the neutral player who receives the ball will become an attacker, while the one who does not receive the ball will quickly move into a defensive position. The two defenders on the field will rotate the defense, aware that recovery and rebalance will come from the man on the side opposite to the ball. The rotation will then see the two attackers become defenders, the two defenders become neutral players, while the two who were previously neutral players will go into the two lines at midfield to start attacking again when it's their turn.
