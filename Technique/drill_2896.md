**Progression:**
It is a 2x2 exercise but with 1-1 defense, where each player will defend half the field after completing their attack. The attack will have free touches but a limit of 3 passes to conclude (if the goal is scored with one touch, it will count double). The defender of the furthermost area cannot cross the halfway line to return to their defensive zone, where their partner is located. It is very important that the attacking pair does not start the attack until the coach blows the whistle, so the coach will direct the pace of the exercise and create the situations they want to occur. A priori, it is clear that there will be many types of numerical inequalities to work on, but there will also be the improvement of other resources. These are concepts that can be applied if our defense uses switching or zoning, as these defenses rely on defensive jumps, closing passing lanes, covers, and intense pressure on the ball handler almost independently of losing one-on-one. It is also an exercise applicable in those weeks of competition when we want to work on offense because we will face teams that use this type of defense.
