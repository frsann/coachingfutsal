# Drill 13768

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The main objective of the activity is primarily to create isolation situations in collaboration with the player on the outside in the offensive half of the field.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
We will have two teams of 3 players plus 2 goalkeepers on the field, on a pitch approximately 28x20, with one player per team on both sides at the halfway line. The game does not include corner kicks and throw-ins, with goalkeepers always having multiple balls near the goal to make the exercise extremely dynamic. The two teams, when in possession, can make a pass to the outside teammate, but only if this is done just beyond the halfway line. On the first pass, the joker will immediately come onto the field instead of the one who passed the ball; otherwise, they can only pass again. The defensive aspect, through coverages, delaying, and defensive rotations, as well as supports to maintain reference to the ball and opponent, should definitely not be underestimated.
