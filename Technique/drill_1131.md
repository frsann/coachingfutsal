**Duration (min):**
From 10’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
9 players: divided into 3 teams, each marked by a color.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the teams.

**Progression:**
BALL POSSESSION WITH 3 COLORS. It's a 6 versus 3 game in one half of the field, with the goal of maintaining ball possession. The game is played with a maximum of 2 touches of the ball; 2 differently colored teams attack and the team of the third color defends. The change of role occurs when the defending team intercepts the ball or sends it out of the playing area. The team of the color that last touched the ball defends. POINTS OF FOCUS: Encourage quick passing, immediately pass the ball to the open teammate. Penalties can also be introduced: e.g., after 15 consecutive passes, the team has to defend for one extra turn.

**Variations:**
It is possible to change the touch limitations: 1, alternatively 1 and 2 touches.
