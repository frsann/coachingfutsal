**Short description:**
The area size is 30x15 (10x15+10x15+10x15). There are three teams, where the team in the middle box defends, and the teams on the sides aim to maintain possession of the ball.

**Objectives:**
Ball control and the first line of defense

**Area (mxm):**
30x15 divided into 3 parts

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Vests, balls, cones/hockey pucks

**Progression:**
The objective is to maintain ball possession and make a predetermined number of passes before playing the ball to the opposite end area. NO LOOPS OVER THE MIDFIELD AREA. The same objective continues in the other end area. If the defending team gains possession, the team that lost the ball becomes the defender. Important points: Observe the movements of the defenders and the opening spaces for through balls. Choose the right passes to keep the pressing pressure under control. Pass quality and speed. When defending, collaborate in both areas to regain possession or force the opponent into making an error.
