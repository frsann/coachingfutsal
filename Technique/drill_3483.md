**Short description:**
Exercise where through the structure of the rondo, we can work on individual fundamentals and additionally, we will also work on the role changes of attack/defense - defense/attack in second plays and offensive dualities.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, duality

**Area (mxm):**
9x9

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
6

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
It starts with a classic 4vs2 rondo, when the defense recovers the ball... to exit the "round" they must achieve or complete a "duality" (in the example a block) and pass the ball to one of the 3 external players. See video measures: If your court has the lines of the volleyball field, take half of that field as a reference (9x9m). From there, you can play with the distances, reducing if necessary.
