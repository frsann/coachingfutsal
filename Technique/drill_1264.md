10-12

**Number of players:**
All the players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
Create a square with all the players inside with a ball each. The aim of the game is to protect your ball and kick other players’ balls outside the square. If a player’s ball goes outside the square they are out and must leave the square. The last player with a ball inside the square wins.

**Variations:**
Allow the players whose ball is kicked out to return as defenders (i.e. without a ball).Put the balls around the square with one less than the number of players. On the coaches call every player finds a ball. The player without a ball tries to steal someone else’s. The player without a ball at the end of the time limit (e.g. 20 seconds) loses.
