We organize players as shown in the picture depending on the number of players during training. The action starts with blue 5 moving towards the center of the field. Once in the center, they receive a pass from blue 2 and switch the play to blue 3. They continue moving towards blue 4 and line up behind them. After that, red 3 moves towards the center of the field, receives the ball from red 2, and switches the play to red 5. They continue moving towards red 4 and line up behind them, and so on. It is important to explain to the players the technique of receiving the ball (you can see it in the video clip below).
