# Drill 3391

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The activity proposed by Coach Checa primarily combines the need to accommodate an atypical number of players (in this case as goalkeepers) with the aim of activating collective dynamics that train the team to achieve the session's goals and engage all participants in the training.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, a 3vs3 is developed with the same 'offensive directionality' for both teams, dictated by the need to use only one goalkeeper. Four jokers are used: two located on the sides of the playing field, one positioned in the back with playmaker functions, and the last one, crucial in the scoring phase, serving as a pivot. The 3vs3 takes place in a limited area of the field, and possession is obtained by passing the ball to the jokers. The game is played with two touches. The final move occurs when, after serving the pivot, the player who passed the ball, and only him, along with the associated defender, will support the pivot for a shot on goal.

**Variations:**
At a later stage of the activity, allow the wild cards to pass the ball among themselves.
