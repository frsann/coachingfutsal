# Drill 3637

**Short description:**
Let's divide the field according to the image into three parts, 2 of 10x20 and one of 20x20. In the smaller parts, a 1v1 game is played where the attacker tries to receive the ball from the outside player.

**Objectives:**
Marking the opponent before and after receiving the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12', 6' in 1v1 and 6' in 2v2. Every minute we change the distributors.

**Number of players:**
12 players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Divide the field according to the diagram into three parts, 2 of 10x20 and one of 20x20. In the smaller areas, a 1v1 game is played where the attacker attempts to receive the ball from an external player. Whenever the ball goes out, the external player initiates the attack. The attacker's goal is to receive the ball, protect it, and control its movement to the opposite side of the playing area. The defensive player tries to prevent the attacker from receiving the ball and progressing to the opposite side. If the defender gains possession, they pass the ball to the external player and switch roles, becoming the attacker while the attacker becomes the defender. In the 20x20 area, a 2v2 game is played with two players outside the marked area (one per team), with the same roles as before. Halfway through the exercise, we require both attackers to touch the ball before moving it past the line on the opposite side. If the defenders gain possession, they should pass the ball to their external player. Rotate external and internal players. Players should: reduce the safety distance during the ball's trajectory, apply proper defensive repositioning with the appropriate basic defensive stance, use defensive orientation, defensive intervention, and interception of passes.

**Variations:**
Change the way of controlling the ball when receiving.
