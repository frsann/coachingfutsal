# Drill 769

**Short description:**
Individual technique â€“ Shots in game situations

**Objectives:**
Three situations in the game

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 15'

**Number of players:**
5 players: 1 goalkeeper, 3 forwards, and 1 defender

**Materials:**
2 balls for each group: 1 in the goalkeeper's hand and the other in the hand of a striker.

**Progression:**
The attackers, upon receiving the ball from the goalkeeper: within 6 passes, playing one-touch, on their half of the field and without entering the penalty area, must score a goal. At the end of the first 3x1, the attacker with the ball in hand places it on the ground. The 3x1 situation restarts with the same rules. The defender and the goalkeeper try to interrupt the attack action. Once the situation is over, the last attacker who touched the ball or the defender who conceded the goal remains to defend.

**Variations:**
Each attacker is given a ball.
