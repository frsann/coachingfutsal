**Progression:**
Split the court into 4 equal quarters. Play a normal game of 4v4 plus goalkeepers. There can only be 1 defender and 1 attacker in an attacking quarter of the team in possession when the ball is in there. So if the ball goes into an attacking quarter of the team that is in possession the other players must leave until it is a 1v1 (Note it is only when the ball enters that it must be 1v1, before that there can be any number).

**Variations:**
Extend the rule into the defending half.
