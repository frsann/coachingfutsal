Each team has a ball in hand. After at least 3 passes, you can lift the ball to a teammate, and if they catch it correctly, the other teammate with the ball in hand will put it down and resume playing. The 3 goalkeepers always play in possession to always form a 9vs6 depending on which team has the ball. 15 passes equal 1 point. ALWAYS KEEP BALLS AVAILABLE so that as soon as the ball goes out, another one immediately enters the field.
