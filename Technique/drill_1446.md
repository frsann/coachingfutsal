**Progression:**
A match with four goals according to the layout. Two teams consist of 4 players each. The team playing defense has two players as goalkeepers and two defenders on the field, so the situation is 2v4 in defense. If the defenders gain possession of the ball, they cannot score a goal but must pass the ball to one of the two goalkeepers, and then their attack begins. In the meantime, the defenders take positions on the field, with two at the two goals, and two waiting for the attack of the four opponents.

**Variations:**
Allow pressing after losing the ball (if the ball does not go out). Limit the attack time. Change the size of the field.
