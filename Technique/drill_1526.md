**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Development of a 4 vs 2 situation, speed of passing with finishing

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players: 8 outfield players divided into 4 pairs of 4 different colors, 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the color pairs.

**Progression:**
The game starts on one half of the field with a 4 vs. 2, with a two-touch limit on the ball. To attack the opponent's goal, a pass must be made between the two defenders or 10 consecutive passes must be completed. Once achieved, the team moves to the other half of the field to attack the goal with a 4 vs. 2. If the defenders intercept the ball or send it out of play, roles are reversed; the pair whose last touched the ball goes to defend, and the defending pair switches to attack. The pair that concedes the goal remains to defend. The challenge is won by the pair that scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
Change the touch limit.
