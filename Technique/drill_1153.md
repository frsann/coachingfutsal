**Objectives:**
Shot: in a game situation. Deep movement with delayed defense.

**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 20'

**Number of players:**
At least 3 players: 2 outfield players, 1 goalkeeper.

**Materials:**
Various balls.

**Progression:**
It's a 1 versus 1 game on half the field. An attacker faces the goal they're trying to score in, with a defender's back to them. The attacker starts at their own discretion, with the obligation to touch the defender with their hand. The defender activates only when touched by the attacker. The goalkeeper throws the ball (by hand or foot) into the path of the attacker, who must shoot at the goal before the defender closes in. Once the action is over, they take position in the corner on the opposite side of the field, where a new situation begins. POINTS OF ATTENTION: The shot on goal is executed under defensive pressure, making it closer to the reality of the game.
