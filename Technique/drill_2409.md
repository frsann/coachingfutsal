**Progression:**
Start with 2 lines in the center (divide the team into 2 groups to avoid long waiting times). Begin with the goalkeeper's pass and the defender positioned 8 - 10 meters from the goal. The goalkeeper serves one of the two attackers, initiating a 1vs1 (the other attacker does not participate). The objective is that, when the defender perceives the goalkeeper's throw, they move into the path of the pass to begin defending the 1vs1 situation as close as possible to their direct opponent.
