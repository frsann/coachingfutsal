# Drill 13769

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Making a 2vs2 dynamic, even outside the usual dynamics of an unstructured activity such as having two attackers against two defenders, is very effective when you want to create a connection that can link the 2vs2 in finishing with a processing part, or a 2vs2 in pressure release with a phase of preparation for attack, or a defensive 2vs2 with a triggering phase for the finishing.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Tactically, a 2vs2 game is played on two fields, in each half of the field, with 4 players (2 for each team) on the halfway line in a position oriented to support both 2vs2 situations, in which they can always enter. Essentially, those playing in the 2vs2 can connect whenever they want with a teammate on the halfway line, and it is mandatory to pass the ball to one of the teammates when escaping pressure to then have the right to attack the goal. The player who passes the ball steps out and positions themselves on the halfway line, while the receiver enters the field, dribbling and playing. The activity could be made competitive by keeping scores in both halves of the field for the two teams.
