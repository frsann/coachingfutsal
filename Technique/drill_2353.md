**Materials:**


**Progression:**
On the sidelines, place two cones per side, spaced about 5 meters from the halfway line (distances can be adjusted if you want more 2vs1 or more 2vs2 situations). Then divide the field vertically from the attackers' starting line to 10 meters of defensive territory. The exercise is conducted towards a single goal. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the two attackers, who is faced by the player positioned defensively on the same side. Once in possession of the ball, the player can choose to cross the halfway line, playing a 1vs1 in a quarter of the field, or pass the ball to the player placed diagonally on the other side, initiating a 2vs1 where the other player, located on the receiver's side, must chase to try and restore numerical equality.
