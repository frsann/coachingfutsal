**Short description:**
After the race, a 2v1 follows.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Dribbling and 2v1.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
The first players in two rows dribble the ball as quickly as possible to the end of the field and back. As soon as they pass the ball to the next player, they run to the center where a player awaits with the ball in their hands, arms extended forward. The first player to touch the ball with their hand (flicking it with their hand to try and ease control) plays 2v1 along with the player holding the ball against the opponent who wasn't as quick. Following the completion of the 2v1 attack, the defender runs to the center with the ball in hand, ready to participate in the next 2v1 attack. The two attackers who finished their play go to the end of the rows, each to their own side.

**Variations:**
Change the way of dribbling. A goal is only valid from the first attempt.
