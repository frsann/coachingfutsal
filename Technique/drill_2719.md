**Progression:**
Let's divide the players into groups of 4. Create a square approximately 5x5m. Players stand on the outside of the square behind a cone. 1 ball per square. Players alternate passes in the following sequence for about 1 minute per sequence: Always add one new rule while the previous one remains valid. 1. Passing clockwise with 2 touches for 1 minute, then in the opposite direction. 2. When a player receives the ball and moves towards one of the teammates on their left or right, the whole team shifts in that direction to the empty cone. 3. When a player receives the ball and plays a one-two pass, two players on the opposite side of the square must switch places. 4. When a player receives the ball and moves toward the center of the square, the player on the opposite side steps out to simulate 1v1 defense. 5. When a player who receives the ball passes to a teammate on the left and right and moves towards them to play pressing, the player from the side where the ball came from must recognize this and come for a support pass. 6. When a player who receives the ball is attacked by a player without the ball, the player who passed the ball must come for a support pass.
