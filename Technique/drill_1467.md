**Progression:**
Two teams are playing with wingers moving in the zone near the goal-line. The players are divided as follows: On the large part of the field, the game is played 4v4, with goalkeepers in the goals. In the winger zones, there are two players from each side. Defensive players cannot enter the zone where the wingers are. The team in possession of the ball can shoot either directly or by connecting with the wingers through a pass. Wingers cannot score; they must return the ball to their teammates who then look for a shot on goal. On the coach's signal, players rotate positions.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players. Only the first goal counts.
