**Progression:**
The players pass the ball among themselves, following this sequence: the first color (yellow) passes the ball to the second (blue) and goes to press them. The second (blue) receives the ball and passes it to the third color (red), then makes a deep run. The third color (red) receives the ball and carries it until the second color (red) makes the counter-movement (a typical maneuver in a 2-man attack play between the central and lateral). After completing the movement, the third color (red) passes the ball to the second color (blue), who then passes it to the fourth color (green). The fourth color (green), having received the ball, starts the sequence again.
