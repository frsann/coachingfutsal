# Drill 3681

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Great scoring opportunities are found when we reduce the size of the playing field, in this case to 20x20. Additionally, we play 2vs2, which is the best exercise to train Futsal, and we introduce a moment of transition and imbalance, which increase the number of shots on goal and extremely dangerous offensive actions.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
In terms of teaching, it is played 2vs2 in a 20x20 field, with no sidelines and corners: the goalkeeper of the team in possession will put the ball back into play. The touch is free. The activity is manipulated by placing ourselves off the field, on the sidelines, with two pairs arranged in an alternating manner: one in the lower part of the right half of the field, the partner in the upper part of the left half. When the ball goes out laterally, the team that is in defense will go out, and the pair whose player is in the part where the ball went out, together with the partner from the opposite side, will enter the field. The goalkeeper will put the ball for the pair that remained on the field, in attack. Whoever enters will always do so in defense, while the attackers will try to take advantage of that moment of imbalance.
