**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The video is very explanatory, summary: The central player of the 3 green ones has 2 balls. The first is given to one of the 2 purple players. Whoever receives it must quickly dispose of it with a one-touch pass to a teammate, who then must try to score a goal when they receive it. Meanwhile, the central player of the 3 greens has already initiated a 3vs1 play with his 2 teammates. The purple player who shoots at the goal must then make a retreat to try to help his teammate and form a 3vs2. Once the play is over, there will be a purple player positioned at the back of the field on one of the two sides who will start a 3vs3 transition (he will also have the ball at his disposal), if the defense retreats well. An attack against a set defense will be conducted.
