# Drill 2920

**Short description:**
3 stations to finish at the goal.

**Objectives:**
Improve the action for the finish and enhance the shot.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
Let's make 3 stations as in the pictures below. Divide the players into 3 groups + 1 passer. After a certain time, switch sides of the cones. 1) Pass to the passer between two cones + fake movement to hide from the defender out of sight + sudden arrival in front of him while he is looking at the ball + receiving with the sole while moving forward + shooting at the goal. (Schumi) 2) Pass to the passer + fake movement + change of direction parallel + shooting at the goal or passing to the far post. (Parallel) 3) Pass to the passer + lateral fake movement + entering in front of the defender + receiving while in motion + shooting at the goal. (Pivot reception)

**Variations:**
We can include any specific futsal action (diagonal, 1v1, block...). Position a player at the second post.
