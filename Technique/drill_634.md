**Materials:**
1 ball for each pair, cones to define a series of gates (distance between cones 50 cm), cones to form a square with sides of 2x2 meters.

Two parallel courses can be formed. The pairs perform the exercise alternately. Players must complete the course by passing the ball between the cones; with each pass, they must advance through a gate. Players pass the ball with first intention. Upon reaching the last gate, the holder passes the ball within the square, where the teammate will shoot at the goal. Note that the shot can only be taken within the square.
