# Drill 3159

**Short description:**
20x20, 1vs1, the attacker becomes the defender, a new attacker enters ...

**Objectives:**
Finalization, 1v1.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
All players + 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
We start with one defender and one attacker in the center of the field. The attacker tries to free himself from the defender's marking with a feint and receive a pass as freely as possible from one (of choice) player from the corner to finish the action immediately. Right after the shot, the attacker becomes the defender and attempts to prevent the passer, who has become the attacker, from shooting freely at the goal and so on...

**Variations:**
The player at the corner only starts when the attacker touches the ball, thus taking a shot towards the goal. If the attacker scores, they continue attacking until they miss.
