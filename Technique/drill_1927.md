**Short description:**
1v1 in 3 zones without a goalkeeper

**Objectives:**
Basics of individual technique in defense and offense.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8-12' depending on the needs

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide into 2 teams. Let's determine pairs for 1v1. Divide the playing field into 3 zones as shown in the picture. The 2 end zones are 10m each and the middle zone is 20m. In the end zones, active 1v1 defense is played, and in the middle zone, there is no ball stealing. The winner is the team that scores more goals. Encourage players to use peripheral vision and look to utilize teammate blocks for successful dribbling.

**Variations:**
We can impose penalties for the losing team. We can change the zones where active defense is played.
