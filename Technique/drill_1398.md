**Progression:**
Two teams are positioned according to the diagram, one ball per player. On the coach's signal, a player starts dribbling the ball towards the opposite goal. As soon as they cross the half line, they pass the ball to a teammate positioned 10 meters away, who controls the ball and shoots at the goal. The passer takes the place of the shooter. If the shooter scores a goal, they activate the next teammate who repeats the action. If they don't score, they must dribble the ball back to the starting line to activate a teammate. The team that scores more goals within a set time wins.

**Variations:**
Change the starting position of the teams. Change the leg used for shooting. Change the leg used for dribbling.
