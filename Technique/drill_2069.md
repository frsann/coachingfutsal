**Progression:**
Players are added with one touch and at one moment the attacker lets the ball go through the legs and attacks the goalkeeper, while the defender tries to prevent this. At the moment the attacker takes the shot and the ball goes out, the roles change. The defender drops the ball from their hands and becomes the attacker towards the other goal, and the attacker becomes the defender and tries to reach the defensive phase.

**Variations:**
Work without the ball in your hands, allowing the attacker to change the side of the attack once or multiple times.
