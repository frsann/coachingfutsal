**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Start with 2 lines in the center (divide the team into 2 groups to avoid long waiting times). Begin with the goalkeeper's throw and with the defender at a distance of 8 - 10 meters from the goal. The goalkeeper serves one of the two attackers and a 1vs1 situation is initiated (the other attacker does not participate). The objective is that, the moment the defender perceives the goalkeeper's throw, they move onto the passing trajectory to begin defending the 1vs1 situation as closely as possible to the direct opponent.
