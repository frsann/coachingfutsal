# Drill 3662

**Short description:**
1vs1 challenge with possible wall

**Objectives:**
1v1, wall pass, play on the far post

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
2 forwards and 1 defender. The forward at the free throw line plays the ball to the winger who will start a 1vs1 with the defender coming out of the starting position. The player who passed the ball moves for a potential "give-and-go". The give-and-go can be executed up to a maximum of 10 meters from the goal... after which the 2nd forward goes to the 2nd post. Encourage that if the defender steals the ball, the other 2 do push-ups... thus, the defender will try to steal, encouraging the "give-and-go" play.

**Variations:**
You could try adding a second defender to take care of the second man.
