**Short description:**
After the race lead comes 2v1.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Dribbling and 2v1.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, branded t-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
The first players of two rows dribble the ball as quickly as possible to the end of the field and back. As soon as they pass the ball to the next player, they run to the center where a player is waiting with the ball held outstretched in front of them. The first player to touch the ball with their hand (knocking it with their hand to make it easier to control) plays a 2v1 together with the player holding the ball against the player they outran. After completing the 2v1 attack, the player who played defense runs to the center with the ball in hand ready to participate in the next 2v1 attack. The two attackers who completed the attack go to the end of the rows, each to their own side.

**Variations:**
Change the way of dribbling. A goal counts only from the first attempt.
