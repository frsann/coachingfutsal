**Progression:**
The two teams are positioned in the middle of the field opposite their goal. Each player has a ball. At the coach's signal, one player from each team dribbles the ball towards their own goal, defended by the goalkeeper, and shoots from a distance of 10m. Whoever scores a goal activates the next teammate to follow the same process. If a player doesn't score, they must retrieve the ball and dribble it back to the starting position to activate the next teammate. The team that scores more goals within the designated time period wins.
