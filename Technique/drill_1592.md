**Short description:**
Individual Tactics - Getting Free

**Objectives:**
Concentration. Ability to get free: third man movement.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
6 players: 3 forwards and 3 defenders.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs to define the teams. Cones to form the goals (1.5 meters).

**Progression:**
Make two teams, each composed of two colors (e.g., yellow-blue vs. red-green). The main rule is that players on the same team can only pass the ball to teammates wearing a different color jersey. Therefore, if a yellow player has possession of the ball, they can only pass it to a blue player, who must move to receive the ball. If one of the teams makes a mistake (e.g., yellow passes to yellow), the ball is turned over to the opponents. Otherwise, it is a regular game with mini-goals, and the team that scores the most goals by the end wins.

**Variations:**
Playing with an odd number of players (e.g. 3 yellows + 2 blues): it's easier for the blues to pass but they have more difficulty getting unmarked.
