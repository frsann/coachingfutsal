# Drill 1319

**Short description:**
Let's divide the field according to the image into three parts, 2 of 10x20 and one of 20x20. In the smaller sections, it's a 1v1 where the attacker tries to receive the ball from the outside player.

**Objectives:**
Marking the opponent before and after receiving the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12', 6' on 1v1 and 6' on 2v2. Every minute we change the passers.

**Number of players:**
12 players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the field according to the picture into three parts, 2 of 10x20 and one of 20x20. In the smaller sections, a 1v1 is played where the attacker tries to receive the ball from an outside player. Whenever the ball goes out, the outside player is the one who initiates the attack. The goal of the attacker is to receive the ball, protect it, and control it to the other side of the area being played in. The defender tries to prevent the attacker from receiving the ball and later advancing towards the opposite side. If the defender wins the ball, he passes it to the outside player and becomes the attacker while the attacker becomes the defender. In the 20x20 area, a 2v2 is played with two outside players (one per team), with the same roles as before. Midway through the exercise, we require that both attackers must touch the ball before taking it across the line on the opposite side. For each ball won by the defense, the ball should be passed to their outside player. We rotate the outside players with the inside players. Asking the players to: Reduce the safety distance during the ball's trajectory. Properly apply defensive repositioning with an appropriate basic defensive stance. Apply defensive orientation, defensive intervention, and interception of passing.

**Variations:**
Change the way of controlling the ball when receiving it.
