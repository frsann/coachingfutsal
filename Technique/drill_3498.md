**Area (mxm):**

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 4vs4 game is played with one player who does not participate in the game, with two safe zones for each team arranged diagonally. The player not participating in the game remains stationary in one of the two safe zones with a ball. If, during possession, a player reaches the opposite safe zone, they stop in that zone, freeing the player who was previously stationary with the ball, changing the direction of play and shifting the dynamics to another area.

**Variations:**
Do not limit the free zones, that is, allow stopping in any free zone to free the partner with the other ball.
