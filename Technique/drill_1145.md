The game is played on one half of the field, with all players distributed at the field's corners. The players are divided into two groups, who alternately perform the exercise. The player passes the ball along the line to the pivot, who returns it for the player to take a shot at the goal; then they swap positions. Immediately after, a player from the other group completes the same movement, and so on. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Before taking the shot, the player must make a feint. The pivot's return pass must be lateral and directed towards the teammate's run.
