# Drill 1664

**Short description:**
Applied Technique

**Objectives:**
Pass speed, interception

**Area (mxm):**
2 fields of 10x20 m.

**Duration (min):**
From 8’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
8 players: in each half of the field, two 3 versus 1 situations are formed.

**Materials:**
2 balls. Bibs: to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The game is played with 1 touch. In each half of the field, the defender must intercept the ball. The defender can invade the teammate's half of the field for 4 seconds (becomes a 3x2). Role change: the last person who touched the ball switches to defense.

**Variations:**
When the defender invades the other half of the field, even 1 attacker can do it (it becomes 4x2).
