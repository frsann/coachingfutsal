# Drill 2743

**Short description:**
Supplier, attacker, and defender.

**Objectives:**
Marking a player without the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
7x10m

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on the needs"

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
Basic rules:- The attacker earns 1 point every time they receive the ball cleanly.- The defender earns 1 point every time they intercept the ball under control with their sole.- If the ball is not properly controlled by either the defender or the attacker, no points are awarded.- Once one of the two controls the ball, there is no reaction from the other, and the ball is returned to the passer.The attacker and the defender face each other in an area approximately 7x10 meters, without leaving that area.During the designated time, the attacker plays with the passer and tries to receive the maximum number of passes, while the defender tries to predict and prevent the opponent from receiving the ball.Sessions are played with role changes between the attacker and the defender, and points are tallied to determine the winner.Roles are switched so that three players participate in 3 situations (passer, attacker, and defender).Time: 2 x 2'-3'

**Variations:**
We have two passers playing with two touches, provoking modifications in defensive orientation. (image 263) We have one passer moving along the line in both directions, provoking modifications in defensive orientation. (image 267)
