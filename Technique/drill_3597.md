**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**

**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, a 3vs3 game is played on a reduced field with the 4 jokers positioned on the respective sides of the square. The 3 players in possession must maintain it against 3 defenders, and to do so, they can use the jokers without limits. Each time the ball is passed to the joker, the players in possession of the ball can run outside the perimeter lines of the field to receive a long pass from the joker behind the defender and go on to score in the opposite goal, guarded by the goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
The manipulations for this activity can be many, but actually in this option, they are enough to ensure that the focus is unconditionally directed towards the main objective of the activity: being able to work the ball to find the right time to conquer the space behind the defense.
