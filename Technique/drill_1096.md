**Objectives:**
Dribbling: with 90° changes of direction

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5’ to 15’

**Number of players:**
At least 7 players. 2 groups of 3 players, 1 external player.

**Materials:**
One ball for each player. Cones: the distance between the cones is 2 or 3 meters.

**Progression:**
The external player (in example A) sets the starting times for the players inside the cone grid. All players conduct the ball by performing 180° changes of direction. Following the graphical example: Start times for 1, 2, and 3. 1 starts: when A enters channel 1; executes the 180° change of direction when A passes through channel 3 for the second time. 2 starts: when A enters channel 2; returns when A goes back through channel 2. 3 starts: when A enters channel 3; returns when A goes back through channel 1. POINTS TO WATCH: The length of the grid must be greater than the path covered by the external player (A).

**Variations:**
The number of players per group can be changed: from 2 to 5.
