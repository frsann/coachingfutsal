Balls

**Progression:**
We organize the players as shown in the picture depending on the number of players in training. The play begins with blue 5 moving toward the center of the field. Once in the center, they receive a pass from blue 2 and turn the play to blue 3. They continue moving toward blue 4 and take a position in line behind them. After that, red 3 moves toward the center of the field, receives the ball from red 2, and redirects the play to red 5. They continue moving toward red 4 and take a position in line behind them, and so on. It is important to explain the ball-receiving technique to the players (you can see it in the video clip below).
