**Progression:**
The competitors are divided into two groups, performing the exercise on a 12/12 m field, where four gates are positioned. The competitors from Group 1 start by passing through the nearby gate and aim to succeed in passing through the gates defended by Group 2 without being touched by their opponent. The competitors from Group 2 start immediately after the start of the competitors from Group 1, also passing through the nearby gate, trying to intercept their opponent before they reach the gates they defend. Then, the roles of the two groups are switched.

**Variations:**
Option 2: The exercise is kept the same, but the players now perform the exercise with a ball between their feet. Option 3: The ball is passed to the player, after which they perform the exercise in the same order. We work on the first touch.
