# Drill 788

**Short description:**
Individual technique

**Objectives:**
Precision pass, ball reception.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
At least 5 players.

**Materials:**
1 ball, cones to define the goals (width 1.5 - 2 meters).

**Progression:**
At least 5 players are distributed at each corner of the square (in one corner we will have two players). Player 1 passes the ball to teammate 2, who receives it after the ball has gone through the goal post. With each pass, the player goes to occupy the position of the teammate to whom he has passed the ball. Then, player 2 receives the ball and passes it, in the same manner, to 3. Unexpectedly, the player diagonal to the ball can move to the center to make a one-two; in the example, player 5 moves to the center and performs a triangulation with 3, who then passes the ball to 4 by making it go inside the goal. Once player 4 receives the ball, he passes it to 5 who, in the meantime, has returned to the position from where he started. Player 5 restarts the cycle.
