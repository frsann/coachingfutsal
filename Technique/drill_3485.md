**Progression:**
Two mini matches are played simultaneously on 20x20. The field is divided into 2 zones with a wildcard player who plays indiscriminately in both zones. Each team consists of 1 player plus a goalkeeper who cannot leave their respective zones, and the game is played with 2 balls, one for each zone. The attackers can rely on the wildcard but only when it is located within their playing zone, in such a way that the players with the ball will have to perceive when they can pass to the wildcard and when they have to play 1vs1. The goalkeepers may receive two attacks at the same time.
