**Short description:**
FUTSAL - TECHNICAL FUNDAMENTALS WITH THE BALL - Authors - Roberto Osimani and Mico Martic

**Objectives:**
Shot: in a game situation. Closure on the 2nd post.

**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players: 6 outfield players, 2 jokers, 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the teams.

**Progression:**
It is played 3 against 3, full-court, with two jokers who play one-touch with the team in possession of the ball. The jokers cannot score. A goal in the penalty area is worth 3 points, outside the area is worth 1 point. Defenders cannot enter their own penalty area. Attackers can enter the opponent's penalty area, one at a time and for no more than 4 seconds. Shots on goal must be first-time shots. There are no corner kicks; the ball always goes to the defense. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Seek the solution for the 2nd post, since defenders cannot defend in the penalty area.
