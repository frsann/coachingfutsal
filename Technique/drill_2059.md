# Drill 2059

**Short description:**
Let's divide the field into three parts according to the image, 2 parts of 10x20 and one part of 20x20. In the smaller parts, it's a 1v1 game where the attacker tries to receive the ball from the player outside.

**Objectives:**
Marking the opponent before and after receiving the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12', 6' for 1v1 and 6' for 2v2. We change the passers every minute.

**Number of players:**
12 players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
Divide the field according to the image into three parts, two of 10x20 and one of 20x20. In the smaller sections, it's a 1v1 game where the attacker aims to receive the ball from an outside player. Whenever the ball goes out, the outside player initiates the attack. The attacker's goal is to receive the ball, protect it, and move it in a controlled manner to the other side of the playing area. The defending player tries to prevent the attacker from receiving the ball and later from advancing to the opposite side. If the defender gains possession of the ball, they pass it to the outside player and become the attacker, while the attacker becomes the defender. In the 20x20 space, a 2v2 game is played with two players outside the marked area (one per team), with the same roles as before. Halfway through the exercise, we require both attackers to touch the ball before moving it past the line on the opposite side. For every ball possession by the defense, they must pass it to their outside player. We rotate the outside players with the inside players. Instruct players to: reduce safe distance during ball trajectory, correctly apply defensive repositioning with the appropriate basic defensive stance, and use defensive orientation, defensive intervention, and interception of passes.

**Variations:**
Changing the way of controlling the ball when receiving it.
