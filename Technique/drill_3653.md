**Progression:**
Didactically, a 3vs3 is played on a 28x20 field with 4 neutrals positioned one on each side of the half-field. The game is fluid and continuous except for one manipulation: every time the ball is out on the sidelines or over the end line, or the game is interrupted by a goal, the game resumes with the goalkeeper of the team that has possession. Knowing how to manipulate the context of exercises by highlighting this principle allows us to create a significant improvement in player performance. It is about generating intense difficulty so that returning to the real game context seems easier. The player performs better and the performance improves. If we create an abnormal obstacle on the field, something extraordinary, when we eliminate it, it generates a kind of super-compensation in the player. For this, if we want the game to be fast, fluid, with pushing transitions and defending capabilities, with shots on goal, we should create this type of activity and be present with corrections during the game, as seen with Beso in this case.
