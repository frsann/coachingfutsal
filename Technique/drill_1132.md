**Short description:**
FUTSAL - TECHNICAL FUNDAMENTALS WITH THE BALL - Authors - Roberto Osimani and Mico Martic

**Objectives:**
Passing in game situations. Speed of passing.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10 to 20 minutes

**Number of players:**
At least 6 players, divided into 2 groups.

**Materials:**
1 ball for the group in the center; 1 ball for each pair on the outside. Vests: to define the teams. Cones: to form the goal (from 3 to 5 meters) and the playing area.

**Progression:**
The central group plays a 3 versus 1. The attackers, limited to 1 or 2 touches, score a point if they manage to complete a pass by sending the ball through the goal. The goal is defended by a defender, who switches roles with the last player to have touched the ball if they intercept it. The group outside the field performs passes with the instep, sending the ball over the players engaging in the 3 versus 1. POINTS OF FOCUS: Encourage precision and speed of passing.
