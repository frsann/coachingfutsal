**Short description:**
Individual Tactics

**Objectives:**
Research of effective playing space for finishing. Defensive and offensive concepts in 1x1 and 2x1 situations. Shooting on goal.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5’ to 15’

**Number of players:**
At least 6 players: 2 forwards, 2 defenders, and 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Cones: to define the starting points for the attackers and defenders. Playing field is a half field 20x20 meters.

**Progression:**
The defender passes the ball to the attacker and goes to defend his own goal. The attacker receives the ball and will have 8 seconds to finalize the 1-on-1 action. If the defender steals the ball, he can attack the opposite goal, always within 8 seconds; the action ends when the ball leaves the field of play or a goal is scored. At the end of the action, the players will switch roles, while the other defender begins the new 1-on-1. For the 2-on-1 situation, when the defender passes the ball, both attackers attack. If the defender recovers the ball, the attacker who last touched the ball goes to defend.

**Variations:**
Vary the size of the field, vary the time to finalize the attack action.
