# Drill 13773

**Short description:**
3 stations to the finish line at the goal.

**Objectives:**
Improve the endgame execution and enhance the shot.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
Let's create 3 stations as shown in the images below. Divide players into 3 groups + 1 passer. After a certain time, switch cone sides. 1) Pass to the passer between two cones + fake movement to hide from the defender out of sight + sudden arrival in front of him while he's looking at the ball + receiving with the sole while moving forward + shoot on goal. (Schumi) 2) Pass to the passer + fake movement + change of direction to parallel + shooting on goal or passing to the other post. (Parallel) 3) Pass to the passer + fake side movement + entry in front of the defender + receiving while in motion + shoot on goal. (Pivot receiving)

**Variations:**
We can include any specific futsal move (diagonal, 1v1, block...). Position the player on the far post.
