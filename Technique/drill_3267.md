**Variations:**
Can’t score in the same goal twice in a row.For a point to be scored a successful pass after the pass through the goals needs to be completed.The small goals start as neutral and a team can “own” a goal by being the last team to make a successful pass and reception through it. First team to own all four goals wins.Make the goal s bigger and have goalkeepers in them but they can only save with their feet.
