**Number of players:**
10 players: 8 outfield players divided into 4 pairs of 4 different colors, 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the color pairs.

**Progression:**
Start in one half of the field, with a 4 versus 2 with a two-touch limit. To be able to attack the opponent's goal, you must make a pass between the 2 defenders or complete 10 consecutive passes. Once this is achieved, move to the other half of the field to attack the goal with a 4 versus 2. For role changes, follow the rules of three-color possession. The pair that concedes the goal stays to defend. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Stimulate the precision and speed of the pass.
