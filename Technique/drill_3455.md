**Progression:**
Educationally, a 2vs2 game is played with the help of 2 jokers at the back of the field. During development, it can be required to score a goal only using the joker, or the possibility to score without using the joker can be allowed. If the pass comes from the joker, in this case, the goal must be scored with one touch. What we want to emphasize is that, in case of a goal, those who remain in defense are always the players who had defended previously, and the jokers go on the attack. This may seem insignificant but has high importance because the joker has more "interest" in providing the attacker with an effective pass since it could be properly used to score a goal without having to go back to defense. The focus thus becomes the offensive phase and improving all the fundamentals that can make it more effective.
