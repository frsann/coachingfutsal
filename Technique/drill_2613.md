**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
Players are added with one touch, and at one point, the attacker lets the ball pass through his legs and attacks the goalkeeper, while the defender tries to prevent this. At the moment the attacker takes a shot and the ball goes out, roles are reversed. The defender drops the ball from his hands and becomes the attacker towards the other goal, while the attacker becomes the defender and tries to transition into defense.

**Variations:**
Work without the ball in your hands, allowing the attacker to change the attack side once or multiple times.
