**Progression:**
In one half of the field, a 6 versus 2 game is played; the goal is to maintain possession of the ball. The remaining 4 players are in the other half of the field. It is played with one touch. When the 2 defenders intercept the ball, they play the ball in their hand and pass it to their teammates in the other half. The last 2 players who touched the ball become defenders: one picks up the ball in hand and then moves to the other half of the field, restarting the 6 versus 2.

**Variations:**
The defender does not have the ball in hand, the game is played only with one ball.
