**Progression:**
A real 4v4 game on a 20x20m field. The goal must be scored with a first-time shot from within 6m. We always play on one half of the field and attack 2 goals located on the goal line but within the 6m space. When possession changes or the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper positioned in the corner plays a new ball for the team that has gained possession. At that moment, there is a switch between defense and attack. Change goalkeepers every 5 attacks.

**Variations:**
If a goal is scored, the reward is in the form of a new attack. A goal can also be scored from outside 6 meters. We can also introduce penalties for the team that loses.

**Categories:**
Ball Possession, Group Actions - Build up, Positional Attack
