Two teams. Ball possession at 20x20. Attacking team has 1 player at other half pitch. After 5 passes, change side.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Bibs, balls

**Progression:**
Divide the players into 2 teams. They play a game of maintaining possession in one half. The team with the ball has 1 player in the other half and no other players can be in this half. Once the team in possession makes 5 passes in one half then they can pass to their player in the other half. All the players must now go into the other half, except one player from the attacking half. If the defending team win theball then one of their players can make a run into the other half (and the former attacking player must return) and receive a pass. Each time a team successfully changes the ball to the other half they score a point.

**Variations:**
Include jokers to reduce the difficulty.Allow 1 defender to go in the other half as well.
