**Objectives:**
Ball possession.

**Area (mxm):**
12x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
9

**Materials:**
Balloons, houses, cones.

**Progression:**
Two colors attack and one defends. The attackers must remain 3 inside the area and 3 outside. The players inside must maintain possession of the ball, playing with three touches. The attackers in the center, whenever they pass the ball outside, must switch positions (the one in the center moves outside, the one outside moves inside to play). The role changes whenever the ball is recovered or goes out of bounds without being controlled; the color that last touched the ball defends.

**Variations:**
Modify the number of touches. Modify the size of the field.
