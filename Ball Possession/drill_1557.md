20x14

**Duration (min):**

**Number of players:**
9 players: 3 forwards, 3 defenders, and 1 wildcard who operate within the rectangle; 2 wildcards outside the rectangle, each on the short side of it.

**Materials:**
Cones to define a 20x14 meter rectangle, 1 ball, bibs to distinguish the attackers from the defenders.

**Progression:**
A 3 versus 3 ball possession exercise is carried out inside the rectangle. The team in possession of the ball plays with 3 touches and can use the 3 jokers who play with 1 touch. The team that loses possession of the ball switches to defense, and so on at the end of the series. Change the players' positions after each series. Monitor how the players occupy the playing spaces, particularly in the areas near the sides where there are no jokers.

**Variations:**
Vary the size of the square, the number of touches, reduce numerical superiority, you cannot pass the ball back to your teammate, play only with the non-dominant foot, allow the jokers to move freely outside, vary the number of touches by the jokers.
