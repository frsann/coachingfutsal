# Drill 1729

**Short description:**
40x20, Three zone, possession of the ball.

**Objectives:**
Quick ball recovery.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the playground into three equal parts. In each part, there are 5 players. Two players from the central zone (Zone A) go to win the ball against five players (Zone B) who play first-touch passes and after 7 passes (counting each pass out loud), they can pass the ball to the players in Zone C. If this happens, the other two players from the central zone go to win the ball, and the two who didn't succeed in Zone B return to the central zone (Zone A). When the defensive pair manages to win the ball (by throwing it out of the field or gaining possession and passing it to the other side), it all starts over with the team that lost possession now in the Central zone (Zone A). There are no pauses in the game, everything happens without stops. If the defense throws the ball out, the coach throws a new one to the players positioned in the opposite lateral zone. Only ground passes count.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players and the size of the zones. Three defensive players who remain in the Central zone must always be in the part of that zone which is closer to the ball.
