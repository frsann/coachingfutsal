**Objectives:**

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
12

**Materials:**
Balls, marked jerseys, cones

**Progression:**
Ball possession on 20x20 (20x18 if goals cannot be moved). 4 green players in the square + 2 Jokers + 1 green outside the goal line hold 4 reds in a keep-away game. Jokers (J) play from the first or second pass, as do players standing outside the goal line. If the ball goes to player number 5 who is outside the goal line, a substitution is made. The player who passed the ball takes his place, and he (No.5 green) enters the game. Greens with the ball can cross to the other half, but to return to the half where they have one of their teammates' help, they must make at least 3 consecutive passes on the other half. If the reds win the ball on the opponent's half, they can immediately use 2 Jokers as well as their teammate outside the goal line (No.5 red), but only after 3 consecutive passes on the opponent's half. If they are on their own half, they can use him immediately. Jokers are always in the half where the ball is (they move outside the sidelines from one half to the other).

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the number of mandatory passes. Change the dimensions of the field.
