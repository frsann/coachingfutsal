**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
Twelve

**Number of players:**
12+2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Players are divided into 3 teams of 4 + 2 goalkeepers. The team in possession (A) has one player for every 10 meters of the field and can use the support of the supporting team (C), placed on the perimeter of the playing rectangle. The defending team (B) does not have any limitations. The goal for teams A and C is clearly to maintain possession against the defense of B, which, if it regains the ball, plays a normal 4vs4 against A. At the end of the 4vs4 (ball out or goal), A will go on to defend, B will become the supporting team, and C will be the team in possession. The 4vs4 develops towards the goal of the half where the ball is recovered.
