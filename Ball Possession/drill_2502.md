# Drill 2502

**Short description:**
Ball possession, 4 + 4 vs 4 on 28x18

**Objectives:**
Work on possession in conditions of numerical superiority with defensive repositioning in conditions of numerical inferiority and pressure on the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
28x18

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
3 teams of 4 players, two attacking teams with different markers, red and green, and a defensive team divided into pairs with yellow markers.

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
4 red vs 2 yellow in one zone, 2 yellow in the middle zone are trying to intercept the pass from the reds to the greens. Before passing the ball to the greens, the reds must make at least 2-3 passes among their players against 2 defensive (yellow) players and then pass the ball to the greens (their teammates) positioned on the other side of the field, avoiding the two other defensive players (yellow) located in the central part of the field from intercepting the pass. If the greens receive the ball, the two defensive players located in the central part of the field move to Field 3, and the two yellows from Field 1 move to Field 2. This movement continues until the yellows come into possession of the ball. In that case, the team that loses the ball becomes defensive, and the yellows (defensive) become attackers. Before the exercise starts, all three teams are divided into pairs so as not to waste time when the opportunity arises to change roles on the field. Insist on the pace of the exercise and variations with touch limitations. The ball to teammates from another zone can only be passed on the ground. If the defensive (yellow in the illustration) gain possession of the ball in Field 1, they must pass it to their teammates (green in the illustration) on the other part of the field in Field 3.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the size of the zones. The coach with the balls stands next to the field, and if the ball being played goes far away, he throws a new ball into the game.
