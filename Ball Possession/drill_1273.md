**Progression:**
Split half the court into 4 equal squares. In each square there is 1 player from each team. The players cannot move out of the squares.One ball in play and the team must try to keep the ball for as long as possible.Point for x number of passes or x seconds with the ball.

**Variations:**
Make the 4 squares smaller and have one in each corner. So now there is a space between the squares (so the players must make longer passes).Same as above but have a server for each team in the middle and cannot move. This player must pass the ball to one of their own players and receive it back to score a point. Continue until they lose the ball and then the server from the other team has a go.
