**Progression:**
Depending on the number of players we adjust the size of the area (for 10 players use 8x4). There are 2 defenders inside the area and the rest of the players are on the edge of the area. The players on the edge have a 1 touch limit and must try to keep the ball away from the 2 defenders. If the defenders touch the ball then the last 2 players to touch the ball become the defenders. If the attackers make 15 passes then the defenders stay in the middle for the next go. 1st pass is free.Key Points (Coaching Points):Defenders need to collaborate when pressing

**Variations:**
Play with 2 touch limit.Must have 3 touches.Adjust the number of passes for an extra go.Defenders remain in the middle if a nutmeg (ball through the legs) is made.Just the player who loses the ball goes inside for 1 of the defenders.Can’t pass to the player either side of you.Can’t pass to the player who passed to you.Can’t use the sole.Place cones around the outside and one player is between each set of two cones with two spaces without a player. After passing the player must go to a free space and if they don’t they must defend (can also do where they must run around the circle).On every or X pass must run round the circle, do a press up, sit down, touch a team-mate, switch with a team-mate etc. (can´t pass to the player until he completes the task).Have an additional ball in the hands. The attacker can pick up the ball in play and the ball that is in the hands must be put into play immediately.Have three additional balls in the hands. When a player with a ball in the hands receives the ball in play they must throw the ball in the hands to a player that isn't holding one. If the ball touches the floor then the player who threw the ball and the intended receiver become the defenders.Once a player has touched it they sit down. Aim to get everyone sitting down before defender wins the ball.
