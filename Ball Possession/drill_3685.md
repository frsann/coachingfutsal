# Drill 3685

**Short description:**
Pressure After Task Loss

**Objectives:**
Improving defense after losing possession.

**Area (mxm):**
25x20

**Duration (min):**
6

**Number of players:**
12

**Materials:**
Balloons and farts

**Progression:**
RONDO 4X2. It's played with two touches. If the attackers lose the ball out of bounds: • The last two switch to defense and the other two exchange with 2 of the outside players. (find an activity for the 2 outside) • The two inside, with the other two outside, become attackers. When defenders recover, they must play with an outside teammate to play a 6x4 two-touch in a 40x20 area. If the 4 defenders activate after the loss and prevent the ball from leaving the rondo, they continue attacking. If in the 6x4 the 4 defenders recover, they switch to attack with the objective of exiting the 20x20 while controlling the ball. THE OTHER 6 ACTIVATE TO PREVENT IT. If THE 4 exit THE 20X20, they start attacking in the next round. IF THEY DO NOT EXIT, THEY START OUTSIDE, AND THE LAST TWO TO TOUCH THE BALL START DEFENDING. If the 6x4 reaches 15 seconds (or 10 touches), two from the team of 4 start defending (those who haven't defended for the longest time).
