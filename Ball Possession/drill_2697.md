**Progression:**
The players are organized into 3 groups as shown in the picture. The goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the three players who start conquering the field while respecting the concepts of the 3-1 rotation system. Once the players conquer the field and reach the final third, they can execute one of the actions for goal completion (parallel, double pass, block, schumi). After all three groups have moved to the other side, we start anew from the goalkeeper on the other side.

Limit the number of touches. Determine the minimum number of additions before the finale.
