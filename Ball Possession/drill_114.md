# Drill 114

**Short description:**
4vs4 on 18x18 or 20x20.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession.

**Area (mxm):**
18x18 or 20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
4+2 vs 4+2, 12 players in total.

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
On half of the field, a 4vs4 game is played focused on ball possession with three touches. Each team has two players (Jokers) on the sides of the field (square) who help maintain ball possession. A, B, 1, and 2 can only play with one touch. Every 90 seconds, player roles change. Ten consecutive passes by one team mean additional work for the opponents (10 sit-ups, for example).

**Variations:**
We can play with two Jokers (one Joker per team) on opposite sides of the square. Change the number of touches. Introduce penalties after a certain number of passes. Whoever passes the ball to the Joker takes their place.
