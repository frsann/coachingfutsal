**Progression:**
The fullback (4) moves to pass to the back (2), who plays back to him and makes a false move toward the center. The fullback (4) passes to the opposite back (3), and then continues toward the line, taking position at the back. The back (2) moves diagonally towards the back (3), who receives the ball and carries it towards the center with control. If the passing line to the opposing back (6) is blocked, the back (3) passes to the fullback (4) on the line, who plays a parallel pass along the line to the opposing back (6). The next trio executes the same movements.
