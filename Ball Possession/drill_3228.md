Pass the ball to the high beep. In one half of the field, play 6 against 2; purpose: to maintain possession of the ball. The remaining 4 players stay in the other half of the field. When the 2 defenders intercept the ball, they play the ball they have in hand and pass it to their teammates in the other field. The last 2 who touched the ball become defenders: one collects the ball in hand and then they move to the other half of the field, restarting the 6 against 2.

**Variations:**
The defender does not have the ball in hand, the game is played only with one ball.
