# Drill 3587

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
That proposal is an activity that falls into the category of all those exercises useful for training ball possession. Moreover, there are goalkeepers who participate in the possession and transitions that then lead to shooting on goal.

**Area (mxm):**
24x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The field used is 24x20 and the game is played 5vs5 with goalkeepers representing the 2 extra players for the team in possession of the ball. As in real play, the ball can be passed to the goalkeeper only once. The team that regains possession can immediately attempt to score in one of the two goals, or after one pass—if there is no shot—they maintain possession. The team that previously lost the ball then switches to defense. The match is won by the team that has scored the most goals by the end of the time period.

**Variations:**
One variation could be to give a point for a certain number of completed passes or for time spent in possession. Another is that the goalkeeper can receive the ball passed from the team in possession of the ball, only outside the goal frame.
