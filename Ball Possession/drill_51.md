**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Develop the third player's unmarking time in the 3-player game. Game development using support in the center.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

1 repetition: 3'/4'. From 1 to 4 repetitions

**Number of players:**
8 outfield players, divided into two teams

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to define the teams, cones to define the field.

**Progression:**
A ball possession game is played, 4 against 4. The players must follow these rules: the game is played with a limit of 3 touches; defenders cannot enter the free zone (the center circle); the team in possession of the ball can have only one player at a time enter the free zone and cannot stay there for more than 3 seconds; inside the free zone, the attacker can only touch the ball twice. The aim of possession is to score more points than the opponent: 1 point is earned when a team manages to make 10 consecutive passes; 3 points are earned when the ball is passed to a teammate inside the free zone and the latter manages to pass it back to a teammate outside the circle.

**Variations:**
Vary the number of ball touches, the playing area, the number of players.
