**Progression:**
- Possession Game in 20x20, 4x4 + 1 offensive joker for both teams.- Define a central space of 6x6 meters. Only one attacker can enter this square at a time, defenders cannot enter.- The objective, to score 1 point, is to make contact with a player inside the 6x6 marked space and have them return it outside the square to a different attacker than the one who passed it.- Inside the square, it's played with 2 touches, outside with free touches.- When connecting with the player inside the square and taking the ball outside, the player must exit the square, allowing another teammate to enter continuously, without interrupting possession.- The offensive joker works in elaboration and support, but cannot enter the marked space to score points for any team.
