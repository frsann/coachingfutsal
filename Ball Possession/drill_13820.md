**Progression:**
The players are organized into groups of 3 players. The goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the three players who begin to advance the field, adhering to the concepts of the 3-1 rotation system. When the players advance the field and reach the final third, they can execute one of the actions to finish towards the goalâ€”parallel, double pass, or block. After all the trios have moved to the other side, we start again from the goalkeeper on the other side.

**Variations:**
- limit the number of touches - determine the minimum number of passes before finishing
