**Progression:**
4vs4, 5vs5, 6vs6 The game is played with ball possession on the entire field or on a 28x20 area. Attackers aim to make an auxiliary pass with one of the teammates who must be inside the circle at the center of the field. Defensive players cannot enter the circle. An attacker in the circle can only stay for 4 seconds (assistant coach controls the time the player spends inside the circle). The game is played with 2 or 3 touches. 1 point to the team that makes 10 consecutive passes or one successful auxiliary pass with a teammate in the circle at the center. We change players often.

**Variations:**
A return pass from a player in the center circle cannot go to the player from whom it was received, it must go to a third teammate! Introduce penalties.
