# Drill 118

**Short description:**
4vs2 on a 10x10 with 2 waiting in the other 10x10 zone.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession.

**Area (mxm):**
10x10 + 10x10.

**Duration (min):**
October 12

**Number of players:**
4 vs 4 (8 players)

**Materials:**
Balls, marked jerseys, cones.

**Progression:**
Before the start of the exercise, we split the players into pairs. Four greens play keep-away against two yellows in a 10x10m area. The game is played with two touches. It is enough for the two yellows to force the greens into an error (the ball goes out of the square) or to take the ball and pass it to teammates in the other square, and the game moves to the other square. Two yellow players from the first square and two green players (the pair whose player last touched the ball or caused its loss joins the keep-away) move to the other square where they will play keep-away with four yellows against two greens. The coach with the balls stands next to the field, ready to throw a new ball into play in case the one being used goes far (to prevent wasting time).

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the dimensions of the square.
