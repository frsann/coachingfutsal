**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
Twelve

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Ball possession on 20x20 (20x18 if it is not possible to move the goals). 4 green in the square + 2 Jokers + 1 green outside the goal line keep 4 red in a possession drill. Jokers (J) play first or second touch like the players standing outside the goal line. If the ball goes to player no. 5 who is outside the goal line, a substitution is made. The player who passed the ball to him takes his place, and he (No. 5 green) enters the game. The players in green with the ball can also move to the other half, but to return to the half where they have the help of one of their teammates, they must make at least 3 consecutive passes on the other half. If the reds win the ball on the opponent’s half, they can use 2 Jokers immediately as well as their teammate outside the goal line (No. 5 red), but only after 3 consecutive passes in the opponent’s half. If they are on their own half, they can use him immediately. Jokers are always on the half where the ball is (they move outside the sidelines from one half to the other).

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the number of mandatory additions. Change the dimensions of the playing field.
