The attackers try to keep possession. Once they have made x  passes they can score in either goal. If they score the gk distributes the ball to the one of the attacking players and the attackers must again make 10 passes before scoring. If they miss the team from the player that missed becomes the defenders.If the defending team regains ball possession then they change to attackers (working with one other team) and the team of the player that lost the ball become the defenders.
