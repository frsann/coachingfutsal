The last player (4) plays to the opposite back (3) and continues towards the line, taking up position at the back. The back (2) moves diagonally towards the back (3) to cooperate, plays a one-two with the back (3), and takes his position on the line. The back (3) receives the ball and controls it towards the middle, after which he plays a diagonal pass to the opposing team's wingback (6). The next three players execute the same movement patterns.
