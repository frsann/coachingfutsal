# Drill 100

**Short description:**
Ball possession, 4 + 4 vs 4 on 28x18

**Objectives:**
Working on ball possession under numerical advantage conditions with defensive repositioning under numerical disadvantage conditions and applying pressure on the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
28x18

**Duration (min):**
December 15th

**Number of players:**
3 teams of 4 players each, two attacking teams with different markers, red and green, and a defensive team divided into pairs with yellow markers.

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
4 red vs 2 yellow in one zone, 2 yellow in the middle zone aim to intercept the pass from red to green. Before passing the ball to the greens, the reds must make at least 2-3 passes among their players against 2 defensive (yellow) players and then pass the ball to the greens (their teammates) positioned on the other side of the field, avoiding the other two defensive players (yellow) stationed in the central part of the field from intercepting the pass. If the greens receive the ball, the two defensive players positioned in the central part of the field move to Field 3, and the two yellows from Field 1 move to Field 2. This shifting continues until the yellows gain possession. In that case, the team that loses the ball becomes the defensive team, and the yellows (defensive) become the attackers. Before starting the exercise, all three teams should be paired up so we don't waste time when the opportunity arises for role changes on the field. Insist on the rhythm of the exercise and variations with touch limitations. The ball can only be passed to teammates in the other zone on the ground. If the defense (yellow in the drawing) wins the ball in Field 1, they must pass it to their teammates (green in the drawing) in the other part of the field in Field 3.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the size of the zones. The coach with the balls stands next to the field, and if the ball being played with goes far, he throws a new ball into the game.
