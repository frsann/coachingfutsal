Maintaining possession of the ball. Quick passing. Closing passing lanes.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
9 players: divided into 3 teams, each distinguished by a color.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the 3 teams.

**Progression:**
A 6 vs 3 game is played in one half of the field with the objective of maintaining possession of the ball. The game is played with a maximum limit of two touches of the ball; two teams of different colors attack and the team of the third color defends. The role change occurs when the defending team intercepts the ball or sends the ball out of the playing perimeter. The team that last touched the ball goes to defend.

**Variations:**
You can change the touch limitations: 1, or alternatively 1 and 2 touches. You can also introduce penalties: for example, after 15 consecutive passes, the team remains to defend for an extra turn.
