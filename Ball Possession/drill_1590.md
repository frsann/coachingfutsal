**Number of players:**
9 players: divided into 3 teams, each distinguished by a color.

1 ball. Bibs: to define the teams. Cones: to mark the field 20x14 meters.

**Progression:**
2 colors attack and 1 defends. The attackers must have 3 players inside the area and 3 outside. The players inside must maintain possession of the ball, playing with 3 touches. The attackers in the center must switch positions every time they pass the ball to the outside (the one in the center moves outside, and the one outside moves inside to play).
