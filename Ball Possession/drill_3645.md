# Drill 3645

**Short description:**
4vs2 in 10x10 with 2 waiting in the second 10x10 zone.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession.

**Area (mxm):**
10x10 + 10x10.

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
4 vs 4 (8 players)

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
Before starting the exercise, we divide the players into pairs. Four green players play keep-away against two yellow players in a 10x10m area. The game is played with two touches. It's enough for the two yellow players to force the green players into making a mistake (the ball goes out of the square) or to take the ball and pass it to teammates in another square for the game to move to the other square. Two yellow players from the first square and two green players (the pair whose player last touched the ball or caused its loss enters to play keep-away) move into the second square where they will play keep-away with four yellow players against two green players. The coach stands by the field with balls, ready to throw a new ball into play in case the one being used goes too far (to prevent loss of time).

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the dimensions of the square.
