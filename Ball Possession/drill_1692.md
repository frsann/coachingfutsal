# Drill 1692

**Short description:**
Ball possession through auxiliary passing at 20x20.

**Objectives:**
Improve ball possession with the help of a central player (assist pass) through precise passes, quality receptions, and good openings.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on needs"

**Number of players:**
Minimum 9 players.

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We play possession in an area of 20x20m. In the middle of the field, we set up a square of cones approximately 3x3m in size (see picture). Inside the square is a joker who always plays with the team possessing the ball. Defensive players cannot enter the square, while attackers can only run through it. The aim is to make a supporting pass with the joker. There is no aerial play. Each supporting pass scores 2 points, while 10 consecutive passes score 1 point. For the supporting pass to be successful, a one-two pass must be executed between the attacker and the joker.

**Variations:**
Increase or decrease the playing space and the space where the joker is located. Increase or decrease the number of touches for players and the joker. Introduce penalties for the losing team.
