**Objectives:**
Possession + pressing

**Area (mxm):**
20x20 and 14x14

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
10

**Materials:**
Markers, cones, balls

**Progression:**
We start with a 4v2 possession in a smaller square (14x14). If they manage to string together 5 consecutive passes, the attackers can score in any of the 4 small goals. In the next 5 consecutive passes, the attackers can only score in the opposite small goal from the one where they initially scored. If two players manage to win the ball and pass to the outside players, then a 6v4 possession begins. If they make 10 consecutive passes in this way, the attacking team can score in any of the remaining goals.

**Variations:**
- reduce the number of touches - change the number of passes before shooting at small goals

**Categories:**
Ball Possession, Positional Attack - Exit Pressing, Positional Defense - Pressing
