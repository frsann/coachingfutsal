**Progression:**
The game is 4v4 plus a joker in attack on half a field without goalkeepers. Each team must defend two small goals (for shooting accuracy) set on the same side of the field. Teams can score in either of the two goals. By introducing an attacking joker into play, the team in possession always has a numerical advantage, which means the basic concept of passing is even more important in this exercise.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the playing field. Change the number of touches for players and jokers. A goal can only be scored on the first touch. A goal can only be scored after a certain number of passes.
