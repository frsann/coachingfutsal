**Progression:**
The defender (4) starts with a pass to the back (2), who plays it and makes a fake move towards the center. The defender (4) plays it to the opposite back (3), and continues towards the line, taking a position at the back. The back (2) moves diagonally towards the back (3), who receives the ball and carries it towards the center in control. If the passing line to the opposing back (6) is blocked, the back (3) plays it to the defender (4) on the line. If that passing line is also blocked, the defender (4) returns the ball to the back (3) who has moved closer for cooperation. The back (3) plays a long ball to the opposing back (6). The next trio performs the same movement lines.
