**Materials:**
1 ball. Vests to define the teams. The game is played on half the field with goals positioned on 3 sides of the field.

**Progression:**
The game is played with the same rules as 3-color possession. One team/color defends while the other 2 attack. Roles change when the team in the center intercepts (2 consecutive touches to the ball) or the ball goes out of play; the color that last touched the ball goes to defend. When the teams in possession complete 6/8 consecutive passes, they can attack the goal of the defending color. The game is played up to 2 touches and must end with a first-intention shot on goal. The team that scores the most goals wins the challenge.

**Variations:**
You can also play a 2x2x2. You can vary the number of touches or the role change modes.
