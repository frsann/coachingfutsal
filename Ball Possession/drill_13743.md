**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 3vs3 is played across the entire field (the field size can be reduced if necessary), with free touches allowed. There are 2 jokers for each team, 1 in each penalty area. On the field, 2 goals are marked on each half, outside and in the direction of which the two jokers in the areas must get open to receive the ball. The aim of the 3 players on the field is to find the pivot with a pass into one of the 2 goals. Whoever makes the pass to the pivot switches and goes to the pivot position, while the player who was in the pivot position enters the game, unchallenged, and goes in the opposite direction to find the other joker, freeing up as a pivot in one of the two goals.
