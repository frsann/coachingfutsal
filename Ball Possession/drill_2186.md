**Progression:**
Organization: • Training combinations of 2-4 players related to the 4-0 offensive play system (patterns for breaking the defense) (a) without defenders and possibly (b) with sparring defenders at two ends or on two parallel fields crosswise • Start from a crosspass by field players (see picture) and execute the combination allowing for interchange. Progress progressively from simpler (2 players) to more complex (4 players). For example: • Lift pass (D -> A) • Diagonal pass (B or D -> A) • Rotation to the wing, support for the wing player, wall pass or lift pass (D -> A) • Possibility of lift pass and diagonal pass and securing the attack (opposite wing player) • Support pass and diagonal pass or rotation through the securing player to a deep-lying central player • Wall pass and scoring or a pass to the central player moving to the far post • Three lines, on both sides • Clearing the wing for a 1vs1 challenge (Isolation) • Crosspass, back rotation, a three-line and two starts • Pass past one player to the wing (A -> D) and two starts • Any of the above practiced after 1-2 rotation cycles Key points: • Calm ball handling and rhythm, quick decisions • Use of the sole of the foot for directed control, use of both feet • Relying on a two-touch rhythm
