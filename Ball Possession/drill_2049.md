# Drill 2049

**Short description:**
Three zones, ball possession.

**Objectives:**
Quick ball recovery, closing passing lanes.

**Area (mxm):**
40 by 20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the playground into three equal parts. Each part contains 5 players. Two players from the central zone (Zone A) go to win the ball against five players (Zone B) who play one-touch and can only pass the ball to players in Zone C after 7 passes (counting each pass aloud). If this happens, the other two players from the central zone go to win the ball, and the two who failed in Zone B return to the central zone (Zone A). When the defending pair manages to win the ball (by kicking it out of the field or gaining possession and passing to the other side), everything starts again with the team that lost possession now in the Central zone (Zone A). There are no interruptions in the game; everything proceeds without stoppages. If the defense kicks the ball out, the coach throws in a new one to the players located in the opposite side zone. Only ground passes are valid.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players and the size of the zones. Three defensive players who remain in the Central zone must always be in the part of that zone which is closer to the ball.
