**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
12+2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The players are divided into 3 teams of 4, plus 2 goalkeepers. The team in possession (A) has one player every 10 meters on the field and can use the support of the side-team (C), placed around the perimeter of the playing rectangle. The defending team (B) does not have any limitations. The objective for teams A and C is clearly to maintain possession against B's defense; if B regains possession, they play a normal 4vs4 against A. At the end of the 4vs4 (ball out or goal), A will switch to defense, B will become the side-team, and C will be the team in possession. The 4vs4 develops towards the goal on the half of the field where the ball is recovered.
