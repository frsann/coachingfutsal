# Drill 115

**Short description:**
Ball possession 6vs2 in 2 zones 10x20.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession.

**Area (mxm):**
10x20 + 10x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
12 players (6v6 divided into pairs).

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
We divide half of the playing field into two equal parts (zones). We form two teams of 6 players each and determine working pairs (1-2, 3-4, 5-6 and A-B, C-D, E-F). Players No.1, No.2, No.3, No.4, No.5, No.6 play keep-away with one touch, while players E and F must win the ball. As soon as they win the ball, E or F should pass it to their teammates: A, B, C, and D, who are in the other zone, and move to the other zone to continue the exercise. The pair that loses the ball (e.g., 1 and 2) also moves to the other zone to win the ball. At the beginning of the training, players are required to have maximum concentration. This exercise requires a special readiness to transition from one zone to another and to change behavior from the phase of "not in possession of the ball" to the phase of "in possession of the ball." These transitions occur many times during a match, and it is essential to be able to adapt to the new situation in the shortest possible time.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches (1, two, mandatorily 2, etc...). Change the dimensions of zones. Introduce penalties.
