**Objectives:**
Maintaining possession of the ball. Searching for game rhythm. Switching play.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 7’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
10 players: divided into 2 teams, each distinguished by a color. Each team is composed of 3 players and 2 external wildcards.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the 2 teams. Use ½ field.

**Progression:**
A ball possession game is played on one half of the field in 3x3 situations. Each team with the 2 jokers occupies the opposite flanks. The players in the center play with a limit of 2 touches, the outside jokers with 1 touch. Every time the joker plays the ball, they must enter the field, replaced by a teammate from the center. Be sure to open up the play with a switch when the center of the field is closed. Take advantage of the width of the field when opponents heavily protect the center of the field.

**Variations:**
You can change the touch limitations: 1, or alternately 1 and 2 touches. You can change the space or the number of players.
