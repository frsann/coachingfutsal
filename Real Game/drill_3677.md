**Objectives:**
This type of collective activity has a high cognitive load, as it involves trying to satisfy constraints and achieve objectives, and can serve as significant training for players for two reasons: the dynamic nature of the activity, which includes turnovers, transitions, pressure, and then, as mentioned, the cognitive load of the activity, since thinking requires a great expenditure of energy.

**Progression:**
Educationally, a 4vs4 + 2 goalkeepers game is played with the rule that the game must be played with two touches, precisely to gain an advantage by trying to exploit the manipulation of the activity. Outside, in the substitution area, there is a teammate ready for each of the two teams, with the ball in hand. If a player on the field of the team in possession of the ball decides to take the ball in hand, the player starting from the substitution area enters the field. The player who took the ball in hand exits and positions themselves in the substitution area ready to re-enter; IMPORTANT: the player who enters the field has free touch until they decide to pass the ball.
