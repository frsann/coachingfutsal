# Drill 3719

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The use of a defensive wild card in an activity that already starts with numerical equality creates an imbalance in favor of the defense, and as a consequence, obliges the attackers to find a quick solution to prevent the wild card that used to belong to them from becoming decisive for the opponents, leading to an offensive numerical disadvantage.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The aim, in addition to reaching a high point in the offensive construction process, is to exploit defensive pressure to achieve quick finishing from a transition, without allowing the defensive joker to position themselves. Educationally, a 4vs4 + 2 goalkeepers game is played across the entire field. Additionally, there is the presence of a defensive joker who must always position themselves in the defensive half of the team they belong to. Every time there is a change of possession, the joker changes teams and switches the half of the field for positioning.
