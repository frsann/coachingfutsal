# Drill 3697

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Wildcard activities, if integrated into a full and collective game development, competitive, can cause defensive imbalances to address and adapt to, and offensive advantages to exploit to make the play and finalization effective.

In this specific case, situations also change depending on the area of the field where the wildcards are utilized: advantages/disadvantages in breaking pressure, imbalances in facing the advancement of the action, and changes if the finalization comes from play in the defensive half, as the presence of two wildcards can shift the action from a normal offensive to an attack more akin to power play dynamics.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**

**Progression:**
Educationally, a 4vs4 is played across the entire field with only the limitations and manipulations that apply to the players in the joker position: one plays across the entire field while two are limited to the 10 meters of each half of the field respectively. One could opt for the manipulation that requires the three in the joker position to touch the ball before a completion can take place.
