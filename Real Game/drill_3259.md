https://the-futsal-way.mn.co/posts/vs3-jolly-in-un-campo-di-20x20-mt

**Area (mxm):**
32x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the goalkeepers become two, the field transforms into a 32x20. The game is always 3vs3 and the jokers used are always two. The player who passes to the joker belonging to their team and allows them to enter the game substitutes and becomes a joker. The joker who enters the game is required not to finish immediately but must necessarily pass the ball to a teammate first. In the continuous game, you can choose whether to pass to the joker or not. The offensive and defensive dynamics caused become numerous and are determined by the fact that the joker represents a disequilibrium. Offensively, it is not a true numerical superiority, but an advantage obtainable from:- a spatial superiority- a temporal superiority- a defensive destabilization and consequent adaptation. Defensively, the work of adaptation, defensive rotations, coverage, and pressure on the ball to prevent passing to the joker become characteristics of the game continuously trained with high intensity.
