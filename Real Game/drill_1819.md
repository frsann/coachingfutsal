# Drill 1819

**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Improve offensive plays through regular play and play with a numerical advantage.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20 or 20x20

**Duration (min):**
10 to 12'

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We are starting a 4v4 game, yellow against red. For each goal conceded, the team loses one player: 4x4, the goal becomes 4x3, the goal becomes 4x2. After each 4x2 or 3x1 situation, it starts again at 4x4. If a team scores at 3x4, 1 defensive player goes out and the attackers gain 1, so we will have 4x3, and 4x2 becomes 3x3. In 4x4 and 3x3, even when at a numerical disadvantage, we play freely. 4x3 allows 2 touches and 4x2 allows 1 touch. A goal scored in normal play and with superiority is worth 1 point; in 3x4 and 2x3, it is worth 2 goals, in 2x4 and 1x3, it is worth 4 goals.

**Variations:**
"You can introduce 1 or more jokers. 4x2 also on 2 dodoiras."
