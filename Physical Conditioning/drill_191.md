# Drill 191

**Short description:**
Athletic Preparation – Strength

**Objectives:**
Strength development through a circuit of stations

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 3 to 5 repetitions of both circuits. The recovery between repetitions is 45 seconds. The change of group must be done within 1 minute and 30 seconds.

**Number of players:**
The players are divided into two groups.

**Materials:**
2 barbells, loaded with weights equal to 50% of the player's weight. 6 low obstacles, cones to form the two sprint lines. 1 bench.

**Progression:**
The exercise is developed in two stations. Station 1: the player performs a ½ squat (knee angle 120°), holding in isometry for 8 seconds; then jumps with both feet over the 6 low obstacles (20 cm); then performs a 10-meter sprint. Station 2: place the barbell on the shoulders, perform 8 bounces (going on tiptoes with legs together); then, 6 steps on a bench, with alternating push (step-up), jump alternately with one leg at a time onto the bench; the bench height must be such that it creates a 90° angle at the knees; finally, a 10-meter sprint. At the end of the series, switch the groups of players.
