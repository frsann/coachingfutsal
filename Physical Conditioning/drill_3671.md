**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Challenge in pairs with each person having 2 pins at their sides. When the attacker touches the pin, the defender also has to touch it. In this way, the attacker should attempt to take advantage of the situation to "escape" and pass between the 2 pins of the defender without being touched.
