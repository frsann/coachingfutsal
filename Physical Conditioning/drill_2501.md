# Drill 2501

**Short description:**
Let's make 3 stations as in the picture.

**Objectives:**
Speed + reaction speed.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-14 depending on needs"

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Cone

**Progression:**
1. The player is inside the cone as shown in picture 1.a. The coach calls out the color of the cone that the player must touch with their foot or hand. They touch the side cones with their foot and the cone behind and in front with their hand. When the coach says number 1, 2, or 3 (the number of cones located 10m from the polygon), players must reach them as quickly as possible. Auditory signal. 1.b. Same as 1.a., but now the player must touch the color opposite to the one the coach called out. After that, instead of calling out, the coach throws a ball in the direction of the cones (1 or 2 or 3). Visual signal. 2. The player works on frequency 10m maximum. High knees. Throwback. Combination (one leg high knees, the other throws back). Low knees. Double tap. Throwing with extended knees. 3. We work in pairs. Each player stands beside their cone. One player has an advantage of about 3m. The goal of the trailing player is to touch the leading player with their hand before they reach the target. To reach the target, the leading player must reach a cone 10m away, circle it, and reach a cone placed diagonally 5m away. We have cones placed diagonally on both sides, so the player can choose which direction to go. Swap roles. 3.a. Both players turned in the same direction facing out. 3.b. Both players turned in the opposite direction facing out. 3.c. Both players lying face down on the ground.
