**Materials:**
A ball for each player, cones to form a square. The size of the square should be proportional to the number of players (e.g., 8 players 15x15).

**Progression:**
All players perform ball dribbling inside the square. At the coach's signal (a whistle or other), all players leave their ball and sprint, using the entire field, until the coach gives a new signal. Then the players return to dribbling the ball inside the space until the coach signals again, and so on. The dribbling/sprint sequence will be as follows: - whistle 3” of sprint * whistle dribbling for a time 7 to 10 times longer than the sprint, from 21” to 30” - whistle 5” of sprint * whistle dribbling for a time 7 to 10 times longer than the sprint, from 35” to 50” - whistle 7” of sprint * whistle dribbling for a time 7 to 10 times longer than the sprint, from 49” to 70”.
