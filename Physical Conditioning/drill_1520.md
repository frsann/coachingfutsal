# Drill 1520

**Short description:**
Athletic Training

**Objectives:**
Development of strength resistance, the transmission of the ball over 10/12 meters performed with precision.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
See development table

**Number of players:**
Work pairs are formed.

**Materials:**
With cones, the course is created: 2/3 meters distance between the cones, 10/12 meters between the players. 1 ball for each pair.

**Progression:**
The players positioned at the yellow cones exchange the ball with an inside foot pass with one touch. The trajectory of the ball must be maintained within the space defined by the yellow cones. Each time a player passes the ball, they must sprint to the farthest red cone, execute a change of direction, and return to strike the ball to their partner. On the other side, the partner completes the same sequence. The duration of the exercise can be structured in mini-series, following this Work/Rest ratio: 10" work - 20" rest, 20" work - 30" rest, 30" work - 45" rest, 40" work - 60" rest. Up to 4/5 mini-series can be performed.
