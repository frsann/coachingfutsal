**Area (mxm):**

**Materials:**

**Progression:**
The first two players in the line (in figure A and 3) start by performing a skip over the low obstacles. At the end of the skip, the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the two players, thus beginning a 2-on-goalkeeper situation. The player who receives the ball must finish the action on the second touch of the ball (must necessarily make 2 touches on the ball), either by scoring or passing the ball to the teammate at the far post. The goalkeeper defends their goal. At the end of the situation, the exercise starts over.
