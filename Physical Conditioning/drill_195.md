**Objectives:**
Development of speed and quickness

**Area (mxm):**
40x20. The field is divided into 4 stations.

**Number of players:**
The players are divided into 4 groups, one for each station.

**Materials:**
Station 1: 4 cones, 10 m apart. Station 2: 5 cones 1 m apart, plus 1 cone at 6 m. Station 3: 4 cones, 10 m apart. Station 4: 6 cones, placed 2 m apart.

**Progression:**
Divide the players into 4 groups, one for each station. The 4 groups work simultaneously. Each group repeats its circuit cyclically for 30 seconds, then switches stations.  
Station 1: high knee skips for 10 meters; slow run; high knee skips; slow run; and so forth.  
Station 2: agility slalom between the 5 cones; then a 6-meter sprint; return to the starting point.  
Station 3: 10-meter sprint; return to the starting point with a slow run.  
Station 4: zig-zag run between the 6 cones; return to the starting point with a slow run.
