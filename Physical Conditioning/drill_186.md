**Short description:**
Athletic Training – Aerobic Power

**Objectives:**
Development of aerobic power through a combined circuit

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
Load: 2 to 4 complete circuits

**Number of players:**
At least 1

**Materials:**
Cones, to define the two rows in the center of the field, the distance between the cones is 8 meters.

**Progression:**
The exercise is developed around the combination of the 3 circuits. The 3 stations must be performed consecutively. 

Station 1: line 1, progressive run from post to post; line 2: lateral run to the sideline; line 3: fast backward run to midfield; line 4: sprint to the end of the field; lateral run to the post; start again and perform another full lap. At the end, recovery equal to the work done: approximately 50 seconds.

Station 2: line 1, fast running at 90% of the MAS (maximum athlete speed), from the post to the opposite area limit; line 2: slow run, from the limit to the end of the field, to the second post; fast run to the other area limit; slow run to the end of the field. At the end, recovery equal to 2 times the work done: approximately 48 seconds.

Station 3: line 1, slalom, starting from the end line, with fast running (90%), reach the first cone where a 360° loop is performed with lateral movements, once the loop is completed, proceed to the second cone in the same way, and so on for all other cones; line 2: slow run to the sideline; line 3, fast run 90% MAS, from the end line to the other (40 m); slow run back to the starting point; another full round and then recovery equal to 1 time the work done: approximately 60 seconds.

At the end of the third station, return to the first station to start the entire circuit again.

**Variations:**
Change the starting position of the players to balance the work.
