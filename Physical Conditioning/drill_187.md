**Short description:**
Athletic Training – Aerobic Power

**Objectives:**
Develop aerobic power through changes in pace and direction.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10 to 20 consecutive minutes, depending on the load.

**Number of players:**
At least 1. The players spread out along the baseline.

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Players must run the length of the field, following this sequence: start with a 20-meter sprint, then cover 80 meters at a low-speed run, then sprint for 20 meters and jog lightly for 80 meters, and continue this cycle for the defined time; then move on to a 20-meter sprint followed by a light run for 60 meters, cycling for the designated time; then sprint for 20 meters and jog lightly for 40 meters; and finally, 20 meters of sprint and light jog for 20 meters. For a set total execution time, the distribution can be done according to this scheme: 35% of the time in 80/20; 30% in 60/20; 20% in 40/20; 15% in 20/20. For example, if the total time is 10 minutes, we will have: 3’30” 80 sprint/20 run; 3’ 60/20; 2’ 40/20; 1’30” 20/20.

**Variations:**
Vary the percentages of each segment. The recovery phase can be done at a sustained pace instead of a light one.
