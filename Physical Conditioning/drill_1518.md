# Drill 1518

**Short description:**
Athletic Training

**Objectives:**
General strengthening of the upper body.

**Area (mxm):**
20x40

**Duration (min):**
The duration of the game can vary from 10 to 20 minutes.

**Number of players:**
Two teams are formed.

**Materials:**
With bibs, two teams of equal numbers of players are formed. Cones are used to form a 14x28 m field, like a basketball court. Outside, also with cones, two squares are formed which will be the baskets to attack. A medicine ball weighing 4/5 Kg is used.

**Progression:**
A game is played between the two teams; the goal is to throw the medicine ball into the basket from within the court. Players can only play the ball within the basketball court, and to pass the medicine ball, they must use their hands. The player in possession cannot move with the ball in hand, so progression towards the basket must be made through passes. The team that scores more baskets wins the game.
