**Number of players:**
Groups of 2/3 players with one ball each.

**Progression:**
The players lined up start from the baseline; the exercise begins with the player at the top of the line who dribbles the ball with the other two following them, always maintaining the same distance. After covering a certain distance, the player stops the ball with the sole of their foot to leave it to the player behind them, then moves to the end of the line. The second player continues dribbling the ball and then passes it to the teammate behind them, continuing this way until reaching the opposite baseline from the starting point. Upon arrival, the players immediately return in the opposite direction. Dribbling can be done freely or according to the coachâ€™s instructions, such as dribbling with the sole, the outside of the foot, with one foot only, alternately with both feet, etc.

**Variations:**
You can perform continuous and advancing dribbling movements.
