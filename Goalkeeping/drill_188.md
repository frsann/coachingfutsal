# Drill 188

**Short description:**
Athletic Training – Aerobic Power

**Objectives:**
Development of aerobic power through combined circuit

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
Load: from 2 to 4 complete circuits

**Number of players:**
At least 1

**Materials:**
Cones, to define the two rows in the center of the field, the distance between the cones is 8 meters.

**Progression:**
The exercise is based on the combination of 3 circuits. The 3 stations must be performed consecutively. Station 1: fast run at 85/90% VAM, from the baseline to the other baseline (40 m), then to the halfway point 20 m, return to the baseline 20 m, from the baseline to the other baseline (40 m), then to the halfway point 20 m, return to the baseline 20 m. Circuit Time = 32". Number of Series = 3 Complete Circuits. Inter-Series Recovery Time = 32" equal to 1 time the work. End-of-Series Recovery Time = 30". Total Time = 3' 40". Station 2: 4 jumps with feet together, over the right/left baseline; sprint to ½ court; 4 jumps on the ½ court line; sprint to the baseline; 4 hops; 40-meter sprint, back to the starting point. Circuit Time = 20". Recovery Time = 20" equal to 1 time the work. Total Time = 40". Station 3: sub-maximal run, from the baseline to the first cone and back; then to the second cone and back; and so on to the fourth cone and back. Circuit Time = 40". Recovery Time = 40" equal to 1 time the work. Total Time = 1' 20".
