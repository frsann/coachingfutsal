Reactivity and focus in the parade

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 10'

**Number of players:**
3 goalkeepers, at least 3 outfield players

**Materials:**
Several balls; 3 movable goals are arranged in a cross pattern: the 2 side goals are placed at the edge of the penalty area.

**Progression:**
Each goalkeeper defends their own goal. In the two corners, there are players who pass the balls. The players pass the ball, from the back of the field, to their teammate in the center who comes forward to shoot at the goal. The shooter can freely choose which goal to aim for. The goalkeepers must remain focused at all times, as they do not know where the attacker will shoot.

**Variations:**
Vary the position of players who pass the ball and/or those who shoot at the goal.
