**Short description:**
Goalkeeper in line

**Objectives:**
Goalkeeper in line: lateral support pass and deep pass depending on the forward's positioning. Shot on goal. Save.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
6 players: 2 per team (1 goalkeeper and 1 outfield player), 2 external wildcards.

**Materials:**
1 ball. It is played on half of the field, with 2 goals, regular, on each side. Bibs to define the teams. Cones, at a height of 10 meters to divide the field into two parts.

**Progression:**
The 2 jokers play with one touch each, outside the field and each on their own flank. Goalkeepers and field players play with a limit of two touches. Each goalkeeper can play in the defensive zone (from their own goal line to the 10-meter line); the 2 field players in the offensive zone (beyond the 10-meter line). The action starts with a goalkeeper whose aim is to kick towards the opposing goal. The goalkeeper can play with the external jokers and can shoot at the goal only when he receives the ball from his teammate in the opposite half of the field. He cannot finish beyond the halfway line and always within the limit of two touches. Once the action is over, it starts with the other goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
Do a 2 against 2 in the offensive zone.
