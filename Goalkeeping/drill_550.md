# Drill 550

**Short description:**
The goalkeeper saves the shot after the ball is bounced.

**Objectives:**
Improve the reactions, positioning, and physical preparation of the goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
5-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
3 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Two players are each positioned at their goalposts, several meters away from them. A third player is located at the ten-meter mark. The goalkeeper is on the ground between the first two players, lying on their chest. The two players pass the ball to each other, and the goalkeeper's task is to leap over the ball. After one of the players passes the ball to player number 3, the goalkeeper gets up from the ground and defends their shot.

**Variations:**
Allow player number 3 to choose between taking a shot on goal or passing to one of the first two players, who in that case have the task of "closing" the far post.
