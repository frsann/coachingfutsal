**Number of players:**
12 players: 2 goalkeepers and 10 outfield players.

**Progression:**
It begins with the goalkeeper throwing the ball. The three defenders in the offensive zone try to intercept the goalkeeper's throw. They cannot defend beyond the yellow cone line. When the ball is received by the attackers, a 3 vs 2 is executed. The defenders activate only when the attacker receives the ball. The attackers can receive the ball in the central zone. Once the action is completed, it starts again from the other goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
Introduce limitations on ball touches or time to complete the action.
