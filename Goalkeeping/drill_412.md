# Drill 412

**Short description:**
Defenses after the moves marked by numbers

**Objectives:**
Improve the thinking, movement, and reactions of the goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
5-10 minutes

**Number of players:**
3 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
Using cones, we create 3 imaginary goals in front of the main goal. We assign a number from 1 to 4 to each of the cones. Opposite each of the imaginary goals, we place a player with balls. After one player shouts a number, the goalkeeper must perform a predefined movement associated with that number and prevent the ball from entering the goal.

**Variations:**
Change the cone numbers and the goalkeeper's movement.
