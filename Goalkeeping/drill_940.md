# Drill 940

**Short description:**
Exercise in which we use two screens

**Objectives:**
Improve reflexes and defensive reactions of the goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
5 - 15 min

**Number of players:**
2 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
2 shutters and a ball

**Progression:**
We place 2 partitions at a distance of 8 to 10 meters from the goal. Behind each partition, there is a player with a ball, positioned in such a way that the goalkeeper at the goal cannot see either them or the ball. The goalkeeper does not know which player will go around the partition and shoot at the goal. His task is to save the first shot and quickly "close down" the second player in a one-on-one situation.
