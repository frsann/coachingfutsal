# Drill 632

**Short description:**
Three different reactions in a row with minimal spacing

**Objectives:**
Improve movement speed and reactions.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
10 - 15 minutes

**Number of players:**
3 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
Using cones, we set up three goals within the penalty area. Opposite two side goals are players with the ball, while the player opposite the middle goal is without the ball. The goalkeeper is positioned at the middle goal, holding a ball in his hand. The task for the goalkeeper is to throw the ball into the air, move to one of the side goals where he defends a shot while kneeling, and then quickly return to the middle goal to catch the ball he threw. Once he catches the ball, the goalkeeper slowly throws it with his hands to the middle player and moves to the other side goal where he defends a shot with his foot. After the defense, he sprints back to the goal where he performs a diving save to defend a shot taken by the middle player with the ball that the goalkeeper previously passed to him.
