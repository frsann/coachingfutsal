# Drill 578

**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Exit

**Objectives:**
Exit, in a situation of 2xP and 1xP.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20 meters

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 15'

**Number of players:**
3 goalkeepers, 2 forwards.

**Materials:**
1 ball. 2 goals: 1 at the end of the field, the other at midfield.

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper plays the ball to one of the two forwards. The two attack the opposing goal, which is defended by two goalkeepers. Both can intercept the ball with their hands both inside and outside the area. A 2v1 situation is created, where the defender is a goalkeeper. Once the situation ends, play resumes at the other end of the field, with the goalkeepers exchanging roles. The goalkeeper/defender must know how to stay on the passing line and attack the ball at the right time: low dive.
