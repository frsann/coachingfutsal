# Drill 388

**Short description:**
Closing the second post with a large number of repetitions

**Objectives:**
Create automation in the movement and positioning of the goalkeeper when closing the far post.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
5-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
1 goalkeeper and 1 player

**Materials:**
Rackets, tennis balls, court boundary/cushion

**Progression:**
We place a rebounder/barrier a few meters from the other goalpost, angled so that the tennis balls bounce towards the goal. The player hits the tennis balls with a racket towards the rebounder/barrier. The goalkeeper's task is to cover the other goalpost in a cross position and prevent the tennis balls from entering the goal.

**Variations:**
Give the player the freedom to choose between hitting the bottom/board and a direct shot to the near corner of the goal.
