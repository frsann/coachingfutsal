# Drill 232

**Short description:**
Movements and reactions

**Objectives:**
Defensive reactions and goalkeeper movement in 1-on-1 situations

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
2 x 1-2 minute

**Number of players:**
1 player and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
7 to 12 balls are arranged along the six-meter line from the outside (the number of balls depends on the goalkeeper's age and physical readiness). The player moves from ball to ball as they choose. They can either shoot the ball or continue moving to the next one. The goalkeeper's task is to follow the player's movements from the inside of the six-meter line and block their shots in the cross position.

**Variations:**
We can give the player the freedom to dribble past the goalkeeper with the last few balls.
