**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Save

**Objectives:**
Ball transmission, the reaction time in the save whose main purpose is balance, in fact, to be effective in lateral movements, the goalkeeper must continuously maintain balance.

**Area (mxm):**
The penalty area

**Duration (min):**
From 5’ to 15’

**Number of players:**
3 goalkeepers: 1 goalkeeper with 2 wingers

**Materials:**
1 ball

**Progression:**
The 2 external goalkeepers play with one touch and only inside the area. At the start, they must shoot on goal within 10 passes to score; if they score, the goalkeeper stays in goal. In the next round, they have one less pass available (after the first goal, they have 9 passes available, and so on) to score; if they fail to score and/or the goalkeeper intercepts and blocks a pass and/or the ball goes out of the penalty area perimeter, the goalkeeper who made a mistake goes in goal. The player who concedes 9 goals first loses.

**Variations:**
You can play with more than one goalkeeper within the area, the same rules are maintained. The goalkeeper lies supine with their hands raised, and as soon as the shot arrives, they get up and save.
