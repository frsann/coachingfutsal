# Drill 1562

**Short description:**
Goalkeeper in line

**Objectives:**
Distance shot. Save and shot on goal with the goalkeeper out of the goal.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5 to 15 minutes

**Number of players:**
2 goalkeepers, who alternate as attacker and defender.

**Materials:**
1 ball. The entire field is used. With 4 cones, two lines are formed at 12 meters from the goal.

**Progression:**
The goal is to score with a long-distance shot. The goalkeeper moves with the ball at their feet and can kick towards the opponent's goal only in the offensive zone (between the midfield line and not beyond the 12-meter line). After a save, if the ball stays in play, the goalkeeper can also kick the ball from their half of the field (defensive zone). In other cases, such as a goal, a shot out, or a deflection out, the goalkeeper must carry the ball and kick it in the offensive zone. The player who scores the most points wins the challenge.
