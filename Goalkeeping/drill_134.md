**Materials:**
Several balls; 3 mobile goals, arranged in a V shape, one attached to another.

**Progression:**
Each goalkeeper defends their own goal. In the two corners, there are players distributing the balls. The players pass the ball from the back of the field to the teammate in the center who comes forward to shoot at the goal. The attacker can score in either goal. The goalkeepers must each defend their own goal, also saving deflected shots. Reactivity is encouraged, as goalkeepers can deflect the ball towards the other goal defended by their teammate.

**Variations:**
Vary the positions of the passers and/or the finishers.
