# Drill 458

**Short description:**
Reaction to two strikes from different distances with minimal time interval

**Objectives:**
Improve the reactions and positioning of the goalkeeper

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
10-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
1 player and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Balls, cones

**Progression:**
We arrange the balls at the penalty area in pairs so that the player can take a shot while running with one ball and then the other. A few meters outside the goal, we set up a smaller goal made of cones. The goalkeeper is in the main goal defending the first shot. After defending the first shot, the goalkeeper moves to the smaller goal and, while in a cross position, defends the second shot.
