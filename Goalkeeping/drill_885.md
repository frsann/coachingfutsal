# Drill 885

**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Save

**Objectives:**
React with agility on side shots.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5 to 10

**Number of players:**
1 goalkeeper, 2 forwards.

**Materials:**
At least 6 balls.

**Progression:**
The balls are placed in the lateral zones of the field. P2 and P3 take turns shooting at the goal in sequence. P1, facing away with one hand on the opposite post from where the ball is being kicked, turns around at the goalkeeper's signal and attempts to save the shot. After this, they position themselves on the post and continue the work from the other side of the field. The shots are taken from a distance of 7-10 meters. The challenge is won by whoever concedes the fewest goals. The goalkeeper must try to cover the near post with their body, leaving no space.
