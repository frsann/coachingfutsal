# Drill 254

**Short description:**
A 3 versus 2 game on a shortened field with the goalkeeper acting as the third player.

**Objectives:**
Improve the goalkeeper's football game.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
3 x 3-4 minutes

**Number of players:**
4 players and 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Assistant goal, balls, bibs

**Progression:**
We set up an auxiliary goal between the penalty area and the center. Players are limited to 2 touches while the goalkeeper's play is limited to 4 seconds. The task of the players is to use the goalkeeper as much as possible so that he is forced to play with his feet more.

**Variations:**
Restrict players' movement to only one side of the field so they have to use the goalkeeper even more to change sides.
