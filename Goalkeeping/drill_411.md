The goalkeeper is a few meters out of the goal in a split stance. The goalkeeper's task is to prevent the balls from entering the goal without touching the ground with hands or the bottom of the shoes. Throughout the entire series of shots, the goalkeeper must remain in the split position.

Throw the ball with hands from a shorter distance to make it easier for the goalkeeper to get used to the movement.
