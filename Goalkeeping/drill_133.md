**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Save

**Objectives:**
Stop after lateral movement

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 10'

**Number of players:**
At least one goalkeeper and one forward.

**Materials:**
Various balls near the forward, cones: to form two vertical rows of colored pins starting from the goal line two meters from the posts.

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper positions himself at the center of the goal. The coach/attacker, with the balls placed at 8 meters, calls out a color. The goalkeeper goes to touch all the cones of the corresponding color, first in one row then in the opposite row, then returns to the goal and saves the direct shot. Note: The arrangement of the cones must be random to always promote diagonal movement and facilitate different types of interventions depending on the goalkeeper's position.

**Variations:**
Vary the cone course. Finish at the net with more balls.
