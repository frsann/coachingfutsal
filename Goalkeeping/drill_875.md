# Drill 875

**Short description:**
Classical reflex exercise with tennis balls using multicolored markers

**Objectives:**
Improve the reflexes and thinking speed of the goalkeeper

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
10-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
1 goalkeeper and 1 coach/player

**Materials:**
Tennis balls, racket, and markers in at least 4 colors

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper stands on the goal line facing the net. Markers in different colors are arranged on the net. The coach stands 8-10 meters from the goal with a racket and tennis balls, and his task is to shout out one of the marker colors that are in the goal. After the goalkeeper touches the given color with his hand, he turns around and defends a series of 2 to 4 tennis balls.

**Variations:**
We can change the distance from which we hit tennis balls, as well as the way (high or low). If we want to make the exercise more challenging or easier for thinking, the number of markers in the goal can vary from 2 to 6.
