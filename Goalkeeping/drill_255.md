# Drill 255

**Short description:**
Reflex reactions to balls bounced off the wall

**Objectives:**
Improve the goalkeeper's reflexes for close-range shots and changes in ball direction.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
2 x 2-3 minutes

**Number of players:**
2 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Assist goal, balls

**Progression:**
We place an auxiliary goal a few meters opposite the wall. Players are positioned on the sides of the goal outside the goalkeeper's line of sight and alternately shoot balls against the wall. The goalkeeper's task is to prevent the balls from entering the goal.

**Variations:**
If we want to achieve a greater intensity and number of reactions, we can replace the normal ball with tennis balls and direct the hits using a racket.
