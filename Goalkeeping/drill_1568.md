2 balls. The entire field is used.

**Progression:**
The defender D1 kicks the ball toward the goal from 10 meters (the free throw point). Immediately after, the coach passes the ball to the goalkeeper and D1 falls back in defense. The goalkeeper kicks the ball with his feet to one of the three forwards in the opposite half of the field. The defender D2, along with D1, must defend the goal in a 3 versus 2 situation. Once the play is over, the exercise continues by taking the free throw on the other side of the field and starting again.

The goalkeeper must throw the ball deep, with first intention (1 touch).
