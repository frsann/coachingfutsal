# Drill 128

**Short description:**
Goalkeeper â€“ Kick + exit + save

**Objectives:**
Throw-in, reactive save, and breakaway against the goalkeeper

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 10'

**Number of players:**
3 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
At least 2 balls

**Progression:**
P1, at the start, turns and passes the ball with his hands to P3, who in the meantime has gotten free behind P2. Then he immediately blocks P2's shot; as soon as it is blocked, P3 starts dribbling and goes into a 1-on-1 situation with P1. At the beginning, P3 hides by aligning with P2 to move when P1 turns. Depending on the distance, enable your teammate to control the ball in the shortest time possible. Choose the optimal technique depending on the distance of the teammate.

**Variations:**
Vary the distance and position of the receiver.
