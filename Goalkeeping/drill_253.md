# Drill 253

**Short description:**
Pair warm-up on 2 parallel goals

**Objectives:**
Quick lateral movement, crossing setup, and reaction.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
2 x 1-2 minutes

**Number of players:**
2 players and 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Assist goal, ball

**Progression:**
The auxiliary goal is set parallel to the main goal within the penalty area. Players number 3 and 4 pass the ball to each other, and they are allowed to shoot only with the first touch into the near corner of the goal. The task of goalkeepers number 1 and 2 is to track the movement of the ball and position themselves crosswise, protecting the near corner of the goal.

**Variations:**
We can perform this exercise in such a way that the players pass the ball with their hands, and the goalkeepers protect the upper near corner of their goal.
