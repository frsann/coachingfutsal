**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Throw

**Objectives:**
Free throw save. Blocking and fast break. Long throw with hands. Defense in a 2-on-1 situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 20'

**Number of players:**
2 goalkeepers, 2 forwards, 1 defender, and the coach with the ball in hand behind the goal.

**Materials:**
2 balls. The entire field is used.

**Progression:**
The defender D shoots at the goal from 10 meters (penalty spot). Depending on the defense by P1, two different actions will develop: if the goalkeeper blocks the ball, they throw it deep with their hands; in other cases, they immediately receive the ball from the coach behind them and play it deep with their hands. As soon as D takes the penalty shot, A1 and A2 attack the opposing goal, D retreats to defend in a 2 against 1. The attackers can receive the ball only after they have crossed the midfield. D can intercept the goalkeeper's throw. Once A1 and A2 receive the ball, they attack in a 2x1 against the goal defended by P2 and D. After the action, the last player who touched the ball goes on to take the penalty shot and then to defend, while the other two players become attackers. This way, the exercise starts again with P2. The coach must immediately return the ball to the goalkeeper, who has to quickly decide to whom to pass the ball.
