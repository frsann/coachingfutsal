# Drill 446

**Short description:**
Defense of 4 different goals by passing through obstacles

**Objectives:**
Accelerate the goalkeeper's movement, improve reactions.

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
5-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
4 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Large cones in 2 colors, balls

**Progression:**
In the middle of one half of the field, we make a square whose sides are equal to the width of the goal. We fill the square with large cones. Opposite each "goal" is a player with balls. The goalkeeper's task is to move as quickly as possible through the cones from goal to goal and prevent the ball from entering the goal.

**Variations:**
We can assign a number to each goal. When a player shoots, they announce the number of the next goal that the goalkeeper must go for.
