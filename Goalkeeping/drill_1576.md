**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Save

**Objectives:**
Close save with quick reaction.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 10'

**Number of players:**
1 goalkeeper, 3 forwards.

**Materials:**
2 balls.

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper positions himself 2 meters outside the goal. Two attackers position themselves near the posts with a ball each, and they must not be seen by the goalkeeper. The third attacker positions himself at the edge of the penalty area. One of the two attackers passes the ball to the teammate at the edge of the area, who shoots towards the goal. The goalkeeper reacts as soon as he sees the ball. The pass must be made unexpectedly, catching the goalkeeper by surprise.

**Variations:**
The goalkeeper has his back to the forward at the edge of the box, so he doesn't see how he approaches the ball.
