10-15 minutes

**Number of players:**
3 players and 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
Cones, balls

**Progression:**
Place 2 cones several meters outside the goal. One player is opposite the cone while the other two are in side positions. Each player has a ball. The side player executes a drop-kick towards the goalkeeper who catches the ball and returns it gently on the ground to the same player, who then moves to the central goal to perform a one-two with the central player. While the pass is being played, the side player takes a shot with the ball previously passed to him by the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper's task is to return to the goal as quickly as possible and block the side player's shot. The same thing is repeated from the opposite side.
