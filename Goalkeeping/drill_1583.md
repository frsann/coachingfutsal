The goalkeeper P2, in the opposite penalty area, throws the ball high, either with his hands or feet, simulating a goal kick. Goalkeeper P1 leaves the goal and goes to intercept the ball, thrown by P2. After deflecting the ball, P1 quickly moves back towards the goal to defend it from P3's attack. Once the play is over, they move to the other side of the field. The goalkeeper, coming out for the high ball, must deflect it towards the sideline.
