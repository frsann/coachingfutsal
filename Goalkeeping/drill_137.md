# Drill 137

**Short description:**
Goalkeeper - Position

**Objectives:**
Dynamic fundamental position

**Area (mxm):**
The penalty area

**Duration (min):**
From 5' to 15'

**Number of players:**
3 goalkeepers: 1 goalkeeper with 2 external forwards

**Materials:**
1 ball

**Progression:**
The 2 external goalkeepers play with one touch and only inside the area. At the beginning, within 10 passes they must shoot at the goal to score; if they score a goal, the goalkeeper remains in goal. In the next round, they have one less pass available (after the first goal they have 9 passes available, and so on) to score; if they don't score and/or the goalkeeper intercepts and blocks a pass and/or the ball goes out of the penalty area, the goalkeeper who made the mistake goes in goal. The first to concede 9 goals loses.
