**Short description:**
Goalkeeper in line

**Objectives:**
Side support passes with a 2+3 playing system. Shot on goal. Save.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 5’ to 15’

**Number of players:**
4 goalkeepers: each goalkeeper defends their own goal and attacks the other 3.

**Materials:**
1 ball. It is played on half of the field, with 4 regular goals, placed 2 on each side of the field.

**Progression:**
Everyone must play with 2 mandatory touches. The goalkeepers must pass the ball to each other, executing the ball circulation of the 2+3 system. When the coach calls a goalkeeper's name, upon receiving the ball, he shoots at one of the 2 goals in front of him. If the defending goalkeeper deflects the ball and it remains in the field, all other goalkeepers can kick it towards any goal. The action ends when the ball leaves the field of play.
