**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**

**Progression:**
A realistic 5v5 game + Joker attacker per team on a 40x20 field. It's a realistic game where each team has one Joker who enters the game when the team wins possession of the ball. Since they are Jokers, there is no need to substitute them with goalkeepers. The goalkeeper can assist the team in escaping a press as in a normal game but cannot cross to the opponent's side to attack 6v4. When switching roles from defense to attack, the attacking team's Joker enters the game, and the defending team's Joker exits the game. The entering Joker always does so through the defensive half. The team attacking 5v4 can vary its attacking system, while the defending team uses either a 1-1-2-1 (diamond) or 1-2-2 (square) formation depending on how the opponent attacks.

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts.
