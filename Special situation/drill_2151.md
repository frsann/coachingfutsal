# Drill 2151

**Short description:**
Real game on 28x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers.

**Objectives:**
We are working on collective tactics for 4v3 attack-defense situations. Simulate the basic concepts of the game system specific to advantage-disadvantage situations in special 4v3 situations, whether in defense or attack.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
8 + goals

**Materials:**
Balls, branded T-shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
A real 4v4 + goalkeepers game on a 40x20 field. The defensive team always defends with a disadvantage, with three players, while one stays on the offensive half waiting for teammates to defend and then become attackers. If the attackers score a goal, they continue attacking, this time in the opposite direction, and this continues until defense prevents them from scoring. The coach changes the defensive formation with a disadvantage from 1-2-1 to 1-1-2.

**Variations:**
A goal only counts from the first attempt.

**Categories:**
Special situation - 3v4 - Defense, Special situation - 4v3 - Attack
