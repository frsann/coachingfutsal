**Objectives:**

10 to 20 minutes

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 8 outfield players divided into two teams.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs for defining teams

**Progression:**
The futsal game is played with the following special rules: in the defensive zone, the play is 3 against 4; in the attacking zone, it is 4 against 3. The team in possession of the ball is the one with numerical inferiority, and before they can advance vertically to the pivot located in the other half of the field, they must make at least three passes in their half. After succeeding, they can attack the goal in a 4-on-3 situation. If they lose the ball, the winning team can shoot at the goal. Every time the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper's throw-in continues. Once a team manages to make three passes and move forward, the defensive team with numerical superiority will leave a player in the other half, and the exercise continues on the opposite side.

**Variations:**
Conclude the numerical superiority of 4 against 3, within a defined number of steps or within a specific time. Initially, the initial number of additions must be achieved.
