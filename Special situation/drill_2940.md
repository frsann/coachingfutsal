# Drill 2940

**Short description:**
In half the field, a team attacks with a numerical advantage of 5x4 or 6x4 depending on where the Coach places the ball.

**Objectives:**
Create mechanisms and routines for defensive adjustments against the 5x4.

**Area (mxm):**
1/2 Field

**Duration (min):**
3 minutes or 8 balls each team

**Number of players:**
10 + 2 GR

**Materials:**
8 Balls + 1 movable goal

**Progression:**
The exercise is organized on half the field, with a team of 4 players defending in numerical disadvantage, with structural positioning depending on which athlete the Coach passes the ball to. 1 - If the ball is given to the central player (fixed), the team attacks the "normal" goal of the field, and the defending team is structured in 1.2.1. 2 - If the Coach places the ball with one of the players in the lateral corridor, the team attacks the goal placed on the opposite sideline, and the defending team should adjust and be structured in 2.2. In this video, when attacking in the 2nd approach, the team uses the player positioned on the half-field line (the fixed player); however, I recommend not doing so, and when this is the case, they should attack in a 2.1.2 formation, meaning this athlete should not be inserted in this approach, and only use 5 players, using 6x4 only in the 1st approach.
