# Drill 92

**Short description:**
4vs3, the pivot waits on the other side.

**Objectives:**
4v3, transitions.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
4+1 against 4+1 with reserves

**Materials:**
Balls, branded t-shirts

**Progression:**
4v3 on half the field. The fourth defensive player is alone on the other half of the field, waiting for their teammates to win the ball and place them in a 1vGK situation. The goalkeeper tracks this player. The team attacking with 4 players knows that in case of losing the ball or a poor end to the play, there is one opposing player alone. The attacking team, when the play finishes, retreats very quickly with only 3 players, with the fourth remaining on the same half of the field. This way we change the roles of attack and defense. If the attack does not score a goal, the opponent takes a free kick from 10 meters. Note: The assistant coach, immediately after the attack is over, passes the ball to the goalkeeper with the aim of surprising the defense with a quick goalkeeper throw to the pivot.

**Variations:**
Limit attack time, change the number of touches.
