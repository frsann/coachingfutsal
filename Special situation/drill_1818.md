# Drill 1818

**Short description:**
4v3 Work on markup replacements

**Objectives:**
Improving defensive foundations by starting from situations of numerical disadvantage, aiming to cut off an attacker by closing passing lines to them while putting pressure on the player with the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
Educational Unit: Defensive Basics. Stage: Post-technification. Contents: Space control, floating, retreat, timing, control of the field of vision and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a real game on a 40x20 field, always playing defense with a disadvantage of 3v4. The defensive team, although outnumbered, must press to prevent the progress of the game towards our goal. Attackers cannot cross to the attacking half before making at least 2 passes. (If we want, we can prohibit crossing to the attacking side with high passes). Once the attackers cross to the attacking side, the defenders can play defense through pressing or play a special 3v4 defense. When a role change occurs, one player from the team losing possession must exit, and one player from the team gaining possession enters from their side of the field. Ask the players for: Pressure on the ball. Reading defensive orientation and defensive orientation in pressing. Space control. Use basics such as timing and floating. Spatial mastery of game progression settings.

**Variations:**
The goal from the first counts.
