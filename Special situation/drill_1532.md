**Progression:**
The themed game begins with the ball with the goalkeeper, who cannot throw it beyond the halfway line. The team in possession must break out of the opponent's pressing in a 3 vs. 3 situation. If they manage to pass the ball beyond the halfway line to their teammates, they can play in a 4 vs. 3 situation in the offensive zone. Once the action is completed, a player returns to the origin half of the field (any player can return) and the game starts over. The challenge is won by the team that scores the most goals.
