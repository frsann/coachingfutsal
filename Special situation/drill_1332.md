# Drill 1332

**Short description:**
Real game on 28x20, 4v4 + goalkeepers.

**Objectives:**
We are working on collective tactics for attack-defense situations 4v3. Assimilate the basic concepts of the game system designated for advantage-disadvantage situations in special situations 4v3, in the case of defense or attack.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
8 + goals

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
A real game of 4v4 + goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. The defensive team is always defending with one player less, with three players, while one stays on the attacking half waiting for his teammates to defend and thus become attackers. If the attackers score a goal, they continue attacking, this time in the opposite direction, and so on until the defense stops them from scoring. The coach changes the way of defending with a disadvantage from 1-2-1 to 1-1-2.

**Variations:**
A goal only counts if it's from the first touch.

**Categories:**
Special situation - 3v4 - Defense, Special situation - 4v3 - Attack
