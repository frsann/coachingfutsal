**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on 40x20. The player who acts as the goalkeeper-player for each team is placed on the sideline around the center in the area bounded by two cones, 20-25 meters from their goal. A regular 4v4 game with goalkeepers on 40x20 is played, where the team that has possession has the option to play 4v4 or to activate the goalkeeper-player with a pass and attack with 5v4. So, for the 5th player to join the attack, they need to be activated by a pass through the space bounded by the cones. When the team playing the goalkeeper-player finishes their attack, the goalkeeper-player returns to their bounded space.

**Variations:**
A goal is only valid from the first touch.
