**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Exit from pressing, attack and defense in a 4 against 3 situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 4 forwards, and 4 defenders.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
A futsal match is played with the following special rules: in the defensive zone, it is played 3 against 4; in the offensive zone, it is played 4 against 3. The team in possession of the ball is the one at a numerical disadvantage, and before they can play a vertical pass to the pivot, who is in the other half of the field, they must make at least three passes in their own half. Once they succeed, they can attack the goal in a 4 against 3 situation. If they lose the ball, the team that gains possession can shoot at the goal. Every time the ball goes out of bounds, play resumes with a goalkeeper throw-in. Once the team manages to make the three passes and vertical pass, the team that was defending in numerical superiority will leave a player in the other half of the field, and the exercise resumes from the opposite side.

**Variations:**
Conclude the numerical superiority of 4 against 3, within a defined number of passes or within a determined time.
