# Drill 1556

**Short description:**
Collective tactics - Transitions

**Objectives:**
Retreat, counterattack, 4x3 situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 8 field players, divided into 2 teams.

**Materials:**
1 ball, vests to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The game is played 3 on 3, with 1 joker in the offensive zone. The goalkeeper passes the ball to a teammate, starting a 4 on 3, and the action must be completed in 6 seconds. Once the action is complete, the last player to touch the ball remains as the joker (so they do not defend), while the other 3 quickly fall back to defend. The goalkeeper quickly returns the ball, thus creating a new 4 on 3 situation, which must always be completed in 6 seconds. The joker cannot score a goal. Goalkeepers must keep the balls above the goal in order to immediately put the ball back into play; transition times need to be fast. The team that scores the most goals wins the challenge.

**Variations:**
Determine a number of steps to conclude (e.g., 6 steps). Even the joker can score the goal.
