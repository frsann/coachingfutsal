**Short description:**
I work with 3 goalkeepers in half the field NUNO DIAS CLINIC 2024 SAN DONATO 00:11:00 approximately

**Objectives:**
Goalkeeper incorporation  
Pressure after loss

**Area (mxm):**
25x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 3P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
4 yellow players attack a goal defended by a goalkeeper plus 4 whites. At any moment, they can involve a goalkeeper among the 2 placed at 25 meters, separated only by a cone. If one of the 2 goalkeepers receives the ball, they have 4 seconds in the other half or are free if they pass the halfway line. Their goal is to immediately find the open teammate (defense of 4 players, attack with 5 including the goalkeeper). If they're unable to attack, they can involve the other goalkeeper and continue like this. The defense, to "switch roles," must serve one of the goalkeepers. If they receive it, they must quickly find the open ball because those who were attacking switch to defending and will likely be disorganized. Roles don't change until the defense serves one of the 2 goalkeepers.
