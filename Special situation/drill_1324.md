**Progression:**
Zone defense. Zonal defensive concepts, defensive rotations. Real game on 28x20, 4v4 + 1 Joker attacker (1 Joker for both teams) + goalkeepers. Defense always operates on the defensive half of the field. We establish guidelines on mobility to avoid static attacks in 5x4. If we have a goalkeeper who can attack 5x4 or with a Joker, the attack can operate with greater mobility to attempt to disable the zonal defense. Pay special attention to defensive rotations when adjusting zonal defense whenever ball circulation forces a player out of the 2nd defensive line of zonal defense.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time goal counts.
