4 vs 5 defense, transitions

**Area (mxm):**
32x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
3 defenders against 5 attackers (3 building and 2 wildcard finishers). The wildcard has 2 touches and must decide whether to pass the ball to the far post, to the man between the lines, or to finish. As soon as the action ends, whether itâ€™s with an interception or a finish, the coach introduces another ball into play. The attacking winger on the side where the action developed must run to touch the opponent's goal post before being able to defend, while all others can retreat and the 3 defenders can start a counterattack. Once the coach serves the ball, a 3vs2 +1 situation develops. Additional rules: - If the defense recovers the ball, they continue to attack the other goal and continue 3vs3 with positional attack until the ball goes out of play. The same trios are maintained for about 2 minutes.
