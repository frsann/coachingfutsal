**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. A player taking on the role of goalkeeper-player from each team is positioned on the sideline around the center in an area bounded by two cones, 20-25 meters from their goal. A normal 4v4 match with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field is played, in which the team in possession has the option to play 4v4 or activate the goalkeeper-player with a pass and attack 5v4. Therefore, for the fifth player to join the attack, they need to be activated by a pass through the area bounded by the cones. When the team playing with the goalkeeper-player finishes their attack, the goalkeeper-player returns to their bounded area.

**Variations:**
A goal only counts if scored directly.
