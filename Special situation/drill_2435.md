**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 40x20. The player serving as the goalkeeper-player for each team is positioned on the sideline around the center in an area marked by two cones, 20-25 meters from their goal. It's a regular 4v4 game with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field in which the team in possession can choose to play 4v4 or pass to activate the goalkeeper-player and attack with 5v4. For the fifth player to join the attack, they need to be activated by a pass through the area marked by the cones. When the team with the goalkeeper-player ends their attack, the goalkeeper-player returns to their designated area.

**Variations:**
A goal is only valid if scored directly.
