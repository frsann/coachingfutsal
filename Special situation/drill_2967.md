# Drill 2967

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way: The proposed activity contains the principle of completeness found in the trained situations: a numerical superiority, a special situation, a phase of game 4vs4.

**Objectives:**
It has the principle of continuity in that the stimulated and trained circumstances are not fragmented, but all have a point and, above all, a way in which they are connected to each other.

It also has the principle of competition ready to be realized and underpinning the entire activity, as positive points could be awarded to quartets in the case of success in parts of the activities, thus making the activity itself subject to a final result.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, you start with a defensive quartet consisting of two defenders in the offensive half and two defenders in the defensive half. Those in the offensive half attempt to intercept the goalkeeper's throw-in towards three forwards who are on the halfway line; while the defenders in the defensive half will defend a 2vs3 situation if the goalkeeper manages to reach the three forwards on the halfway line with his throw. If the two defenders intercept the throw, they attack the goalkeeper. In the 3vs2, the three attackers must try to quickly fall back to defend a 4vs3 outnumbered situation. The attacking quartet is formed by all defenders: those who intercepted the goalkeeper's throw, and those who defended the numerical disadvantage. This is followed by a 4vs4 phase starting from the player who did not defend the 3vs4 situation: he moves to the halfway line and can be served directly by the goalkeeper, to stimulate a negative transition from the four who attacked the special situation.
