# Drill 3355

**Short description:**
On the field, the team attacks with a numerical advantage of 5x4 or 6x4 depending on where the coach places the ball.

**Objectives:**
Create mechanisms and routines in defensive adjustments against 5x4.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
3 minutes or 8 balls each team

**Number of players:**
10 players and 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
8 balls and an auxiliary goal.

**Progression:**
The exercise is organized on half of the field, with a team of 4 players defending while outnumbered, using structural positioning depending on the player to whom the coach passes the ball. 1 - If the ball is passed to the player in the middle (fixed), the team attacks the "normal" goal for the game, and the defensive team is structured in a 1-2-1 formation. 2 - If the coach passes the ball to one of the players on the sideline, the team attacks a goal set on the opposite sideline, and the defensive team must adapt and structure themselves in a 2-2 formation.

**Variations:**
Use the joker (6th player) only when attacking the "normal goal".
