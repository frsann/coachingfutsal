**Progression:**
A real 5v5 game on 34x20. One team defends a big goal on the goal line while the other defends two small goals (180 cm). The team playing the defense of the small goals always plays with a goalkeeper-player and defends without changing anything. The other team always attacks with 4 players without changing the goalkeeper with a player. The team playing with the goalkeeper-player must respect the center line of the field as the boundary to which the goalkeeper-player can receive the ball. The team attacking 5v4 can vary the attacking system, while the team defending uses a 1-1-2-1 (diamond) or 1-2-2 (square) depending on the opponent's method of attack. When the defense wins the ball, their task is to score on one of the two small goals, which makes their task more complex.

**Variations:**
Apply more aggressive defense. Only a goal from the first counts.
