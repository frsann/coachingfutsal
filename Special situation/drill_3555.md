# Drill 3555

**Short description:**
4v3 Work on marking substitutions

**Objectives:**
Improving defensive foundations by starting from situations of numerical disadvantage, aiming to isolate one attacker by closing passing lanes to him while pressing the player with the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + y'all

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
Educational Unit: Defensive Basics. Stage: Post-Technification. Content: Space control, floating, retreating, delay (timing), control of the field of vision and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a realistic game on a 40x20 field, always playing defense while outnumbered 3v4. The defensive team, although outnumbered, must play pressing to prevent the progress of the game towards our goal. Attackers cannot cross to the attacking half before making at least 2 passes. (If desired, crossing to the attacking side with high passes can be forbidden.) After the attackers cross to the attacking side, defenders can play defense through pressing or play special defense 3v4. When a change of roles occurs, one player from the team that loses possession must exit, and one player from the team gaining possession enters from their side of the field. Players should be asked to: Apply pressure on the ball. Read defensive orientation and defensive orientation during pressing. Control space. Use basics like delay and floating. Spatial mastery of game progression settings.

**Variations:**
A goal from the first counts.
