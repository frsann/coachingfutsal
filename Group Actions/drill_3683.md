# Drill 3683

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
An excellent activity that encompasses all situations of the Game but has the basic objective of integrating work on set pieces with moments of play, sometimes competitive.

Yes, because training, memorizing, and repeating set pieces sometimes becomes a tedious task that garners little interest from players and becomes less effective for training. If structured in this type of environment, this type of memorization can be integrated with the actual Game.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, the players are divided into two teams starting from a corner, a practiced and memorized play in a 4 against 0. Subsequently, 2 players from one team and 2 from the other become a pair that attacks, while the other pair remains defending their goal. Finally, a 4vs4 is played, and it might start from a play to escape pressure to train and memorize this type of set piece, then allowing free play for a time decided by the coach. The game can become competitive by assigning points starting from the 2vs2, which should have a limited duration, and awarding additional points for scoring a goal to win the 4vs4 moment.

**Variations:**
Instead of pressing out, you can make a sideline throw-in or an offensive play against the set defense.
