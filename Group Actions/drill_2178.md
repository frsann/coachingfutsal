**Area (mxm):**

**Duration (min):**

**Number of players:**
All the players

**Materials:**
Bibs, balls

**Progression:**
Goal-scoring exercise: Two-player attack tactical combinations suitable for the 4-0 offensive play system (defense penetration patterns) at two ends with a total of four execution points, approximately 4 min per combination.

• Wall pass to the middle: Base player 1vs1 challenge, when the defender attacks, an outside pass to the wing player and a quick move behind the defender, wall pass reception and goal scoring. Key points: what is the right time to pass to the wing?

• Front loop or false block: Pass to the wing, front loop or false block for the pressing player with the ball, movement of the player with the ball to the middle to gain space and possibly a penetrating pass to the player who made the false block. Key points: false block on the pressing player's movement line stopping in place and hands down, timing of the player with the ball.

• Diagonal pass: Base player's pass to the wing player, a fake run towards the ball side and a direction change to the center (V-run) to open a diagonal passing line for the wing player with the ball. Key points: “don't turn your back to the ball,” opening the wing player's passing line with a roll towards the center.

• Parallel pass: Base player's pass to the wing player, lift to the base player moving to the wing and goal scoring. Key points: the approach angle of the player without the ball (wall pass possibility), lift to space before the player without the ball, why in the air?

Development:
• Use of passive defenders or assistant coaches to force decisions on players with or without the ball.
• Same combination at all execution points for about 4 min, then change the combination.
• Teaching alternative combinations, e.g., back loop, wall pass on the wing, backdoor, Schumacher.
