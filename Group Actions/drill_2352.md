**Progression:**
From a didactic perspective, the game is free with the only restriction, given the division of players from each team with two colors, to always pass the ball to the opposite color in any situation. This limitation only creates situations that a coach wants to work on: support for the ball, useful movement for the player in possession by those who cannot receive it at that moment, and the search for the third man, mandatory but stimulating, for the player wearing the same color as the ball carrier.
