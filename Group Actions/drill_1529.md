# Drill 1529

**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Improvement of the game with the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
12 players: 2 goalkeepers, 5 forwards, and 5 defenders.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Vests to distinguish teams. Cones: to define the operational area of the pivot, 8 meters from the baseline.

**Progression:**
The exercise will be conducted with a 3 vs 3 in the central area of the field, with the goal of passing the ball to the pivot; the defender marks the pivot until he receives the ball. When the pivot has possession of the ball, the following can occur: the pivot, upon receiving the ball, goes to finish in a 1 vs 1 situation against the goalkeeper (also with a limited number of touches or time: e.g. 4 seconds); a teammate can come to assist the pivot, in which case the defender becomes active, playing 2 vs 1 (again, the play can be concluded within a time limit). The challenge is won by the team that scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
In the pivot area, remove the defender, especially at the beginning of the theme play. The defender can enter the central area to create a 4 versus 3 situation. Exchange positions in play among the various field areas.
