# Drill 3497

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Samperi offers us a game that starts with unstructured group dynamics (i.e., a 3vs3 + 2 goalkeepers) and manipulates it in such a way as to achieve dynamism, changes in the game, and ultimately, thanks to extreme detail, a sudden change in the focal point of the game that surely leads to imbalances in both phases, prompting players to try to resolve them.

**Area (mxm):**
34x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 3vs3 + 2 goalkeepers game is played on a 34x20 field with 2 pivots (1 per team) at the end of the field and 2 jokers (1 per team) in the mid-field corners. Touch is free and the support of the joker or pivot can be used, depending on who has the ball and who is free to receive it. The player who receives the ball can continue in three ways: 1. Pass the ball back with a single touch. 2. Enter the field causing the ball passer to exit. 3. Take the ball in hand, allowing the opposite member of the team (pivot or joker) who has another ball to put the ball back into play.
