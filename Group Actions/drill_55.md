# Drill 55

**Short description:**
40x20. Game with three balls.

**Objectives:**
Reaction speed, thinking.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
5vs5, 6vs6, or 7vs7 with goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts.

**Progression:**
Two teams on the whole field. Each team has one ball held by one of its players. Besides these two, there is a third ball that is played freely. A player holding the ball cannot participate in either offense or defense (they can move around the field) but can "free" themselves by passing the ball to a teammate who then becomes "inactive." If the ball is dropped, the player must run to retrieve it, during which time the game is played 3vs4. The team that scores a goal retains possession of the ball, and their goalkeeper starts the attack.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the dimensions of the playing field (28 x 20). Limit the time the ball is held in the hands. Introduce penalties (such as a penalty shot) if the ball slips out of the player's hands. Introduce penalties for ball slipping (10m, penalty shot).
