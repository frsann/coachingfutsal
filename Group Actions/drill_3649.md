**Short description:**
Warm-up: game on 4 small goals with 1 Joker behind the goal line.

**Objectives:**
Warming up, adding

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10

**Materials:**
Balls, branded T-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
The exercise is conducted on half of the field. It is played 4vs4. Each team can score on two small goals. Behind the goals on the outside of the field, there are two Jolly players who can move along the entire length of the goal line. Let's imagine that 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are in possession of the ball. Their task is to pass the ball to number 1 and score a goal on a return pass. We can require number 1 to play one-touch or two-touch. Also, players inside the field can have restrictions on the number of touches (free, two touches). Every 90 seconds, we change the players on the outside lines. It is beneficial for goalkeepers to participate in this game. In modern futsal, they increasingly resemble field players.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches.
