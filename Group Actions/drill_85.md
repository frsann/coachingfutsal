# Drill 85

**Short description:**
3v3 on a 20x20 with the goal to pass the ball to the pivot after making 2-3 passes, where it's played 2vs1.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, deceiving opponent marking, playing into open space with quick transitions and defensive repositioning.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
An attacking team consists of 3 players + pivot + goalkeeper, and a defensive team consists of 3 players + goalkeeper.

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper must always make a short pass so that a 3 v3 starts on that half. The three attackers must pass the ball among themselves at least 2-3 times before passing it to the pivot. The player passing the ball to the pivot joins the attack, and his direct opponent plays defense against him and the pivot on the other side of the field. If the attackers don't score a goal, the roles change, but if they do, the game continues in the same manner.

**Variations:**
After passing to the pivot, all players attack and all players defend. Defensive players need to prevent passing to the pivot, while attackers need to constantly play between the lines and get behind the defensive players.
