**Short description:**
Playing on both goals with active pressing - Work on defensive substitutions.

**Objectives:**
Preventing progress of the game + pressing + fast finishing + quick attack buildup.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
8 + 2G

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. Once the attackers cross into the attacking half, they can score on either goal. To cross into the attacking half, at least three players from their team must touch the ball before crossing. When the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper of the team in possession returns it to play. When a team wins the ball in the attacking half, they can finish immediately. If they do so on the defensive half, three of their players need to touch the ball before they can cross into the attacking half of the field.

**Variations:**
Only a goal scored with the first touch counts.
