**Progression:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the right back. Simultaneously, the last defender and the left back switch places. The right back passes the ball to the last defender, runs along the line, and abruptly cuts towards the left back. The last defender passes the ball to the left back and spreads out to be ready to receive a long high ball from the left back or to cover the far post. The right back positions himself in the center ready for a support pass, then continues moving towards the far post. The left back, via the right back, delivers a long high ball to the last defender who has spread out and then covers the center. The last defender shoots at the goal or plays the finishing move with the right back. After the attack is completed, all three sprint to the center line, changing their initial positions in the process.

**Variations:**
Golman passes the ball to any of the three players.
