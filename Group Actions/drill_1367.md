# Drill 1367

**Short description:**
Attack on both goals - Work on defensive substitutions.

**Objectives:**
We prevent the ball's progress by playing pressing.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
8 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts

**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. When attackers cross into the attacking half, they can score on either goal. For the attackers to move into the attacking half, at least three players from their team must touch the ball before crossing. When the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper of the team in possession brings it back into play. When a team gains possession of the ball in the attacking half, they can immediately finalize. If they do this in the defensive half, three of their players need to touch the ball before moving into the attacking part of the field.

**Variations:**
Only the goal from the first counts.
