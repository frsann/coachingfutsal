# Drill 165

**Short description:**
Attacking play - one-two pass on the line

**Objectives:**
Duplicate file on the line.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
3-5

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Players are divided into three groups and take positions on the central line (two wide players on the line and one central player in the middle). The goalkeeper passes the ball (goalkeeper's throw or kick) to one of the wide players. Oriented ball control, precise pass to the central player (who provides support), movement along the line, and a quick turn to the middle (as soon as they see the central player starting to change the side of the attack) with the aim of countering the defender who received the ball from the central player to allow passing. The player coming into the middle should be almost in the same line with the player who is passing the ball to them. A double pass on the line follows; the player with the ball passes to the player in the middle and quickly moves forward along the line. The player in the middle makes a first-time pass to the wide player who, after oriented ball control, shoots towards the far post where the central player, having followed the action, adjusts the shot and closes the far post. Pay attention to the details as this is an analytical exercise, therefore without opponents.

**Variations:**
Change the way the goalkeeper adds (by hand or foot). Change the side of the attack. Also pass to the central player.
