**Number of players:**
12 Players + 2 Goalkeepers (2 players from each team, placed in the corners).

**Materials:**
Goals, balls, bibs.

**Progression:**
A 4 X 4 game is played on a 40 x 20 field with free touches (each team has two wild cards in the corners). A goal can be scored without "connecting" with the pivot. If one of the pivots is connected to with "one touch," the player making the pass has to switch places and go to their teammate's position. If one of the pivots is connected to with "two touches," the pivot has two touches to make an assist to their teammate, who is obliged to finish.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches for the attackers. Reward with a DOUBLE GOAL, the goal scored by the "THIRD MAN" when played with one of the pivots. Reward a double goal (in back post actions).
