1 ball. Harnesses for defining teams. Cones for forming goals (1.5 meters) and defining end zones: 6 meters from the baseline. On each side of the field, there are 3 goals: two in the corners and one in the middle.

**Progression:**
The game is played 3 against 3 with two touches, on one half of the field. The game starts by placing the ball on the end line, and while the ball is not moved, the opponents must remain outside the 6-meter line. A goal is valid only when scored in the last 6 meters of the final 8-meter area. A corner kick is taken from the 6-meter line. The team that scores the most goals wins the match.
