**Progression:**
In half court (20x20) there is a goalkeeper in the goal and a 2v2. Each team has one player on either sideline with a ball in their hands. The game has a 2 touch limit.The goalkeeper starts the game by throwing the ball out. If an attacker picks the ball in play up with the hands then they pause and the team - mate that already had a ball in the hands enters and puts that ball in play. The team-mate cannot score with that ball in the same action.The ball that is in play can be picked up as many times as you want. The player who picks it up stands still and the team-mate (with the ball in the hands) quickly starts playing with their ball.The objective is to score a goal with both ball s. If a goal is scored with the 1st ball then the 3 attackers try to score with the second ball.If the defending team steals the ball then they attack together with their team-mate that has the ball in their hands.

**Variations:**
Depending on the number of players this exercise can be made in both halves.Play in full court 5v5.
