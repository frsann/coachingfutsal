**Progression:**
We divide players into two teams. The game is played according to the following rules: - no outs or corners - the attack always starts from the goalkeeper - the player in the central circle cannot leave it - the defender cannot play in their own half - you can only move forward by dribbling or through a double pass After the action: - the attacker goes to the center - the player from the center goes to play defense - the defender goes to the end of the line and waits

**Variations:**
If an attacker chooses 1v1, they finish the action alone. If the attacker chooses a double pass, their defender can be added to them. The player in the center changes every three actions.
