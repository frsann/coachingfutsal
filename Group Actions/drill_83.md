# Drill 83

**Short description:**
4vs4 on a 40x20, 4 in reserve, role change every 3 minutes.

**Objectives:**
Work on transitions, finishing, and defensive repositioning (The exercise is designed as a competition to motivate intensity and focus in defense, the winner is the team that scores a certain number of goals).

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
3 teams of 4 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
From the position as shown in the drawing, 4 attackers, 4 defenders, and 4 substitutes, we start with one of the attackers passing the ball to one of their teammates. The defenders do not prevent this pass. The attackers can then score a goal on either goal, meaning BOTH GOALS can be attacked! If the defensive team (in the drawing in red) gains possession of the ball, they can also score on EITHER GOAL. If the ball goes out (aut, corner), the coach throws a substitute ball back into the field and play continues. The mini-match ends when someone scores a goal or when the ball goes out of play 2-3 times. The teams change as follows: The defensive team goes to rest. The substitute team becomes the attacking team. The attacking team becomes the defensive team.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Defensive players can prevent the initial pass.
