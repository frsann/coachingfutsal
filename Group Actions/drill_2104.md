Attack on both goals - Work on defensive substitutions.

**Objectives:**
We prevent the ball's advancement by playing pressing.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
8 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. When attackers move into the attacking half, they can score on either goal. For attackers to move into the attacking half, at least three players from their team must touch the ball before crossing. When the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper of the team in possession returns it to play. When a team wins the ball in the attacking half, they can finalize immediately. If they win it in the defensive half, three of their players must touch the ball before moving into the attacking area.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time shot counts.
