# Drill 950

**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Improvement of the game with the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 15'. Change the pair of players every 2'/3'.

**Number of players:**
8 players: 2 goalkeepers, 2 forwards, 2 defenders, 2 wildcards.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs to define the teams

**Progression:**
A regular game is played. The joker-pivot plays on the offensive half, only with their teammates when they have possession of the ball and cannot score goals. Players in possession of the ball must finish in the opposing goal, either individually or by using the pivot as support. A goal scored with the pivot is worth 3 points, a goal without the aid of the pivot is worth 1 point. The challenge is won by whoever scores the most points.

**Variations:**
In the center of the field, a 1-on-1 can also be executed.
