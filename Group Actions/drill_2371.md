# Drill 2371

**Short description:**
3x3 on 20x20 with free touches, two pivots and a defender on 10x20 with two touches.

**Objectives:**
I play with pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20 (2 areas of 10x20 and one area of 20x20).

**Duration (min):**
6 minutes.

**Number of players:**
12 players + 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Goals, balls, and bibs.

**Progression:**
A 3 x 3 game is played on the central court of 20 x 20 with free touches / on the 10 x 20 court, two pivots and one defender are placed. They play with two touches. The players on the central court can "connect" with one of the pivots (when one receives, the other pivot becomes disabled). When the pivot receives, only one attacker can enter the zone. A goal is also valid from the central zone.

**Variations:**
Leave the game open to touches in all areas. The goal of "connection with pivot" has double value.
