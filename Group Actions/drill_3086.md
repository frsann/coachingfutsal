**Duration (min):**

**Number of players:**
10

**Materials:**
Balls, vests, cones

**Progression:**
4vs4 on one half. Each team has 2 small goals. Behind the goals, on the outside of the field, there are two Jokers who can move along the entire goal line. The team in possession can score after a pass from the player behind the goal line. We can require a number of passes to be made before being able to score. We can require scoring within a certain time. Players within the field can also have limits on the number of touches. Every 90 seconds, we switch players on the outer lines. It's good for goalkeepers to also participate in this game. In modern indoor football, they are increasingly becoming outfield players.
