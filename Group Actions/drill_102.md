**Duration (min):**
15 minutes.

**Number of players:**

**Materials:**

**Progression:**
Let's divide the field into three zones as shown in the image. The objective is to score a goal under certain rules. The game starts with the goalkeeper passing the ball to player no. 1 or no. 2. A and B try to steal the ball from the attackers. Players no. 1 and no. 2 aim to pass the ball to their teammates in the next sector, where a 2vs2 game begins, turning into 3vs3 since one attacker and one defender join the sector. If the defenders win the ball, they try to score a goal as quickly as possible. The attackers' goal is to pass the ball to no. 5 (the pivot) and thus create a player surplus in the third sector, where the player who made the pass to the pivot joins, resulting in 2vs1. Each team with its goalkeeper attacks for 2’30’’. During the break (1’), we point out any mistakes. We perform 6 repetitions, three attacks per team. Observations: These situations are very similar to the real game. In the first sector, we simulate ultra-offensive pressing by two defenders to which attackers respond by pulling player no. 3 between the lines to facilitate getting out of the pressing. In the central sector, we have 2vs2, a very common situation during a match. In the third sector, the initial 1v1 is a very common situation for the pivot role. The final action is crucial because the pivot needs to find the right time to become available, and the player who passes the ball to him must insert themselves in time after the pass to create a player surplus in the most dangerous area of the field.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches.
