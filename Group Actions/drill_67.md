40x20

15-20

**Number of players:**
4+1 vs 4+1 + reserves

**Materials:**
Balls, printed t-shirts

**Progression:**
A regular 4v4 match with two goalkeepers. The last attacker who touches the ball sits on the ground at the spot where they touched it. They become active the moment the ball crosses the center and run to help the defense. During this time, the game is played 4vs3. If the attack fails to score a goal in two consecutive attacks, the opponent takes a free kick from 10 meters.

**Variations:**
Reduce the number of touches. Limit attack time in excess. The player sitting is activated on the coach's signal.
