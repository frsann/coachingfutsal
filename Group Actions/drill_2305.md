# Drill 2305

**Short description:**
3x3 on 20x20 with unlimited touches, two pivots and a defender on 10x20 with two touches.

**Objectives:**
I play with pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20 (2 areas of 10x20 and one area of 20x20).

**Duration (min):**
6 minutes.

**Number of players:**
12 players + 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Goals, balls, and bibs.

**Progression:**
A 3 x 3 game is played on the central 20 x 20 court with free touches / on the 10 x 20 court, two pivots are placed, and one defender plays with two touches. The players on the central court can "connect" with one of the pivots (when one receives, the other pivot becomes disabled). When the pivot receives, only one attacker can enter the area. Goals from the central zone are also valid.

**Variations:**
Leave the game free of touches in all areas. The "connection with pivot" goal is worth double.
