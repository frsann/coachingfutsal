**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Two-man game with the pivot in a lateral position.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10 to 20 minutes.

**Number of players:**
8 players: 2 goalkeepers, 3 forwards, and 3 defenders.

**Materials:**
Balls, cones: to create neutral zones (3x3 meter square), bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The players are divided into 2 teams of 3 players each. The game is played on half a court, with safe zones present at each corner. The attacking players can enter the safe zone, one at a time and for no more than 4 seconds; defenders cannot enter the safe zone. A goal scored from a pass within the safe zone is worth 3 points, from any other part of the field it is worth 1 point. The winner is the team that scores the most points.

**Variations:**
Vary the number of players on the teams; introduce one or more wildcards; impose limitations on ball touches.
