**Progression:**
Didactically, a quartet performs a play which can be an exit from pressure, lateral, etc., towards a goal. On the way back, whoever finished at the goal will be the defender, against the 3 quartet teammates who will attack in a 3vs1 towards the opposite goal. Once this is finished, the 4 will defend against another quartet in a phase of continuous play. Training set pieces in a dynamic context also means this, if there is a need to do it 4 against 0. That is, then subordinating the execution of the play to another phase of dynamic activity. Moreover, moving to a second step with asymmetry and from this to ending with a phase of continuous play makes the activity absolutely complete, something to always strive for in our training sessions.
