# Drill 148

**Short description:**
4+1 vs 4+1. We activate the joker when we deliberately throw the ball out from the opponent's half of the field.

**Objectives:**
Repositioning, quick finish.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
4+1+J vs 4+1+J

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
4+1 vs 4+1. Each team has one Joker who stands with the ball outside the sideline. The Jokers are positioned diagonally relative to one another. They can move behind the line within a 10m space (from the goal line to the 10m mark). Teams play with pressing because when the opponent crosses into the attacking half of the field, they can deliberately throw the ball out of play to activate the Joker, who attempts to surprise the defense with a quick pass and put the attackers in a position to score. Goals can also be scored in the normal way, i.e., without using the Joker. A goal scored with the help of the Joker is worth 2 points.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches (e.g., 2 touches on the defensive half, but unlimited on the offensive half of the field).
