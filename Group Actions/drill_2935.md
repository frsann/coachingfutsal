# Drill 2935

**Short description:**
Advanced progression, with 2 supports for each team, one at the back and another on the side, for overlapping and vertical walls.

**Objectives:**
Mainly focus on pair routine, attacking against low defenses (finishing with vertical walls and second entry) and off-ball play (overlaps).

**Area (mxm):**
1/2 Field

**Duration (min):**
2 minutes (4 sets)

**Number of players:**
8 + 2 GR

**Materials:**
Balls and 4 vests.

**Progression:**
This is the advanced and final sequence of action defragmentation for the game. In my opinion, it should be applied only after a few training sessions using the previous ones, allowing athletes to better understand its dynamics and objective. On a half field, structure Gr + 2 + 2 supports (1 at the end and 1 on the side) x Gr + 2 + 2 supports (1 at the end and 1 on the side). Reduced game Gr +2x2 + Gr, in which the end supports upon receiving the ball can assist for an inner or outer finish, however, if that is not possible, they can enter the field only by continuous dribbling towards the defensive side until being replaced by the teammate (overlapping) who was coming for the second pass. After this pair action, the game returns to 2x2. Regarding the side supports, they can only enter the field without the ball by overlapping their teammates.

**Variations:**
At an even more advanced stage, we can add 2 more supports to each team, so we will have 4 supports each (2 at the back and 2 on the side) (12 players in total).
