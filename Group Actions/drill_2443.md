Individual marking. It's allowed to double up (assist) a teammate for a 2v1 in defense. If the ball is won in the opponent's half, a goal can be scored immediately (meaning all players do not need to touch the ball before the finish). If after winning the ball on the opponent's half a goal is scored after a maximum of one pass, it counts as double.
