**Progression:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the right back. At the same time, the last player and the left back switch places. The right back passes the ball to the last player, moves along the line, and suddenly turns towards the left back. The last player passes the ball to the left back and spreads out to the side, ready to run to cover the far post. The right back shows up in the middle, ready for a supporting pass, and then continues moving towards the sideline, ready to receive the parallel pass. The left back passes a parallel to the right back and after the pass covers the center. The right back shoots on goal from the parallel or completes the finish with the last player. After the attack is finished, all three run to the center line, changing their initial positions.

**Variations:**
Golman passes the ball to any of the three players.
