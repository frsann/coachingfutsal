# Drill 107

**Short description:**
Parallel, three attackers start from the center, without opponents.

**Objectives:**
Parallel.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Initial player positions: Player no.1 (the one moving along the parallel) takes the position of the central attacker/defender. Player no.2 (the one passing the ball along the parallel) is in the right-back position. Player no.3 and the remaining players (no.5, no.6, no.7) position themselves at the left-back position and have possession of the ball. Player no.4 takes the pivot position (when the ball reaches no.1, the pivot moves to the center and then spreads to the opposite side, "closing" the other post). Player no.3 (as well as the next one from his column) passes the ball to player no.1, waits for him to move on the parallel, and performs "coverage" by positioning himself in place of player no.1. Player no.1 passes to player no.2 "in two times" and, with a change of direction, seeks the ball on the parallel in rhythm. Player no.2 passes a high (outside lob) ball into empty space along the sideline of the field. Player no.1, who arrives in space "immediately" after the ball, can: go 1vs1 against the goalkeeper, shoot at the goal or pass the ball to the pivot (no.4)… In this way, we have continuous player rotation, each performing several elements of applied technique (uncovering, positioning, dribbling) and basic techniques (passing, ball control, ball handling…). The pass from player no.2 must not be along the ground because the ball, due to speed, would be unreachable for no.1 or easily won by defensive players; it must be lifted (lob shot) with the outer part of the foot. Player no.2 performs 6-7 passes and changes position. Player no.1 moves to the pivot position after the parallel. The pivot (no.4) after completing the action stands in the column behind player no.3.

**Variations:**
We perform the exercise first on the right side, then on the left side. It is done on both halves of the field. Goalkeepers combine warm-ups at the goal with general mobilization exercises.
