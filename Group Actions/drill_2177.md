# Drill 2177

**Short description:**
Themes: Area defense, defense in shorthanded situations

**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
Forty

**Number of players:**
All the players

**Materials:**
Bibs, balls, cones

**Progression:**
Organization: 2 teams with 12 players each. Both teams have a playing coach. Two playing formats, each lasting about 20 minutes:
a) Both teams have one joker player in the attacking zone (e.g. technical area) that enables a power play situation and does not participate in defense after an immediate press. The joker is activated when the team in possession has gained controlled possession in the attacking zone. The objective is for both teams to actively press in the attacking zone to avoid outnumbered situations in their defensive zone and, when defending in their defensive zone, to rely on zonal defense (4vs5 situation).
b) Free 5vs5 play on a full or shortened field.

Development formats (alternatives):
• In joker play, when the opponent is leading or in the last 5 minutes, the goalkeeper can also move to the attacking zone.
• Goals cannot be scored until all attackers are in the attacking zone.

Key points or questions: Individual and group feedback for players from the playing coaches in line with the day's teaching themes.

Defender marking the player with the ball:
• Pressure on the player with the ball, on the attacker receiving the pass, during the pass, or as soon as possible afterwards.
• Locking the center and directing the play to the side in the defensive zone.
• Pressuring the player with the ball in the attacking zone.
• Reading the posture of the attacking player with the ball, anticipating the pass or challenge direction.

Defender marking without the ball:
• Marking rules: position on the center's side, see the ball and player being marked, be ready to attack in front.

Defending as a team:
• Actions after losing the ball: immediate pressure on the player with the ball, cover passing lines to depth, delay, retreat, and organize the defense.
• Quick organization and role assignment of the defense: Who presses/supports/ensures/controls the empty space behind?
• Tightness of the defense and situational shape: center locked, pressure on the player with the ball, support and assurance for the player pressing the ball, control the space behind on the non-ball side, difficult diagonal switches.
• Directing the defense: Who directs? How?

Attacking as a team (framing if necessary):
• Opening attacks with a 4-0 or 3-1 formation.
• In power play, 3-2 group formation and patience: the goal is to move and spread the defensive shape with multiple switches.
