# Drill 1534

**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Exit from pressing, game intensity, transitions.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'.

**Number of players:**
12 players: 4 goalkeepers, 8 outfield players, divided into two teams

**Materials:**
1 ball, vests to distinguish the teams

**Progression:**
There are 4 goals: another 2 in the center of the field. A regular futsal match is played. You can score a goal either in the center goal or the one at the end of the field. If attackers cross the midfield, they must attack the goal at the end of the field. If the center goalkeeper saves, they immediately put the ball back in play to the team that was defending. The team that scores the most goals wins.

**Variations:**
You can also use 3 goalkeepers: the one in the center defends both sides of the goal. Introduce ball touch limitations.
