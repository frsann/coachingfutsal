Balls, marked t-shirts

**Progression:**
In order to cross to the opponent's side of the field, all four players must touch the ball. A goalkeeper's pass does not count as a touch for the player receiving the pass from the goalkeeper. Man-to-man marking. It is allowed to double (assist) a teammate for a 2v1 in defense. If the ball is won in the opponent's half, a goal can be scored immediately (meaning not all players need to touch the ball before the final move). If a goal is scored after winning the ball on the opponent's half with a maximum of one pass, it counts double.

Only the first-touch goal counts.
