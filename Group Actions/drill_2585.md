**Progression:**
4v4 on one goal with a goalkeeper. In a set time period, one team constantly attacks while the other defends. During every game stoppage, the coach throws in a new ball. Two halves are played where the teams switch roles at the end of the first half. If the coach shouts "ball," he throws the ball from the center, if he shouts "1" or "2," then those players standing on the sidelines behind the touchlines introduce the ball when called out. Key words: Defensive reorganization, concentration, intensity.

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts.
