**Progression:**
Game 2vs2 + one player to anticipate the counterattack. 2vs2 on half the field. The third defensive player is positioned to anticipate the counterattack. One defensive player on the other half of the field. If the two defensive players win the ball, they use the third teammate and execute a 2vs1, as well as the goalkeeper when blocking a shot or when the attack is finished (the goalkeeper, therefore, must have many balls nearby or an assistant coach who provides them) in order to start the counterattack as quickly as possible. Attackers, when losing the ball, can only play defense up to half the field. The defensive player not participating in the counterattack is replaced. Two attackers become defensive players after losing the ball. 2vs1: the attacker who finishes the action and scores a goal goes out, and the other attacker becomes the defensive player on that half. The defensive player (2vs1) who concedes a goal, after leaving the field, does 10 sit-ups. 2vs1: after crossing the center, they have 10 seconds to finish the action. Players are substituted at the center.
