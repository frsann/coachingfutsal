# Drill 1363

**Short description:**
2v1 ball possession on a 5x5 m area. Two players try to pass the ball to each other for as long as possible without the defender winning it.

**Objectives:**
Defense basics and types of defense. Knowing defensive basics for winning the ball and closing passing lanes. Learning to control the field of vision (the ball and the opponent without the ball). Understanding the use of defensive feint as a tool to confuse the attacker and facilitate ball winning.

**Area (mxm):**
40 by 20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones, high-visibility shirts

**Progression:**
Educational unit: Individual technique without the ball. Chapter: Beginnings. Content: Defensive feints. Closing passing lanes. Visual field control. Players divided into groups of three. One player plays defense while the other two try to pass the ball to each other as many times as possible on a 5x5 field. Free play. If the ball goes out of the square or is intercepted by the defender, the player who made the mistake switches in. Increasing the play area makes defensive actions more difficult, while reducing the number of touches makes attacking actions more challenging. The progression of this exercise goes from 2x1 to 3v2 and subsequently to various ball possession exercises with a larger number of players as children become aware of the concept of team and collective work. In the same way, we can reduce the size of the square in a 2x1 possession situation and force the defender to act from inside the square while the attackers are outside of it. Ask the players to perform feints with all body parts to confuse the passer and receiver along a potential passing lane. Instruct players to maintain a basic defensive stance when shifting, keeping enough tension to effectively react to the attackers' movements. Control of the visual field.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the square.
