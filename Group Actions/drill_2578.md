**Progression:**
4v4 with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. A real game with two balls. If the ball goes out of bounds, whoever gets to it first takes it (attacker or defender), and if the ball goes out for a goal-kick, either the goalkeeper or the attacker takes it (the defender is not allowed to take the ball).
