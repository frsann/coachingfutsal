# Drill 2810

**Short description:**
Let's play with two balls. When the ball goes out, it can be retrieved.

**Objectives:**
Real game modeled. Finalization.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
10+ 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
4vs4 (or 5vs5 or 6vs6) with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. Realistic play with two balls. If the ball goes out of the sideline, it is taken by whoever reaches it first (attacker or defender), and if the ball goes out over the end line, it is taken by the goalkeeper or the attacker (so the defender cannot take the ball).

**Variations:**
2 or 3 first-touch goals
