# Drill 2918

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way - Diego Podda

**Objectives:**
The proposed activity aims to emphasize the possibility of finalization and consequently the "duty" to limit them and make their existence difficult.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 2vs2 is played with free touch in midfield, with two supports available in the corners of the field. If the ball is passed to one side, assistance will be from the opposite side. Once the action on one side is finished, the other pair will attack. The continuity of play will be short, but the change of pairs on the field will be continuous and dynamic. Players could also be divided into teams as well as pairs, to allow for a team competition with an increasing score for each goal scored.
