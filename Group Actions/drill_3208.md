**Progression:**
4v4 on one goal with a goalkeeper. During a set time period, one team constantly attacks while the other defends. At every interruption of the game, the coach introduces a new ball into play. There are two halves played where the teams switch roles at the end of the first half. If the coach yells "ball," he throws the ball from the center; if he yells "1" or "2," then the players, standing on the side behind the touchlines, throw in the ball when called. Key terms: defensive reorganization, concentration, intensity.
