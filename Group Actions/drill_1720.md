# Drill 1720

**Short description:**
The goalkeeper passes to the side. One-two with a teammate in the circle or 1v1.

**Objectives:**
Improving individual defensive skills: Defending against the double pass in a 1v1 situation

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
We divide the players into two teams. The game is played according to the following rules: - no throw-ins or corners - the attack always starts from the goalkeeper - the player in the central circle cannot leave it - the defender cannot play in their own half - one can only move forward by dribbling or via a double pass

After the action: - the attacker goes to the center - the player from the center goes to play defense - the defender goes to the end of the line and waits

**Variations:**
If an attacker chooses 1v1, they complete the action alone. If the attacker chooses a one-two pass, their defender can join in. The player in the center changes every three actions.
