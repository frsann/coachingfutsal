**Progression:**
The task begins with a throw from the goalkeeper with a hand / the two defenders block the throw, and if they recover, they perform 2 x goalkeeper. If the goalkeeper "connects" with the attackers, they attack the goal and can play with either of the two pivots. If they score, the defenders repeat; if they don't score, the attackers become defenders. The goal is also valid without "connecting" with a pivot. The players acting as pivots cannot finish.
