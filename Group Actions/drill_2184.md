**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Organization: 
• 5 groups of 4 outfield players (or alternatively two teams of 10 outfield players). Goalkeepers are included in the exercise. 
• The attacking team (4 + goalie) starts with a goal throw-in or free-kick from their defensive zone during a pressing break situation. The same area also starts with 4 defending players who aim to regain ball possession for their team and score a goal. 
• If the attacking team manages to open up to their player above the halfway line, the team defending the attacking area becomes passive and moves to the attacking end to await the next defensive turn. A new defending team moves onto the field from the defending team's end, allowing the team in attack to continue their attack in their attacking zone. If the attacking team scores a goal or loses the ball in the attacking zone, it immediately transitions to defensive play in the attacking zone.

Development:
• In attack openings, varying the starting formation, but defaulting to the practiced 4-0 
• In the final phase, possibly familiarizing with one or two pressing break patterns from MH: (a) clearing the side starting from 4-0, (b) cross runs

Key points and questions, with emphasis on attacking play:

Attacking as a team 
• In attack openings, creating a numerical advantage in the area (4-0 or 3-1 formation with a false pivot) 
• Applying rehearsed attack rotations to create passing lines and advance routes directed in depth 
• Relying on the principles of U19 futsal national team's attacking play: support, safety, width, and progression 
• Remembering fundamentals: e.g., playing stance and visual control of the field, movement without the ball 
• After losing the ball, immediate transition to defensive play

Defending as a team 
• In the attacking zone, a cohesive intensifying press of 4 players: pressing and directing, support, securing, and closing behind 
• Collective action: moving the defense formation as one, reacting to slow/difficult passes 
• Defense formation tightness: closing the center and deep directed passing lines, strong side 
• In the defensive zone, immediate press on ball carrier and delaying advancement, quick regrouping into defensive formation and organized defensive play.
