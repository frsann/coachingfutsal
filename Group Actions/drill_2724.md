**Progression:**
The ball is thrown by a goalkeeper who is not in the goal. The game is played 3v3 on a 20x16m field. Three defenders wait on the 10m line for the players at the center to receive the ball. Once they receive it, they play offense and can, if they wish, say the name of one of the defenders who then must sit on the ground and quickly get up. To say the name, all must touch the ball. If a goal is scored, the defenders remain. Goalkeepers switch every 4 attacks.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Not everyone has to touch the ball for the name to be said.
