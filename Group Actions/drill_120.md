# Drill 120

**Short description:**
Adding to the pivot, shooting for the goal.

**Objectives:**
Opening passing lanes for the pivot, shooting on goal.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
We work in pairs + pivot. The play is centered on both goals and on opposite sides. The pivot takes a position 6-7 meters from the opponent's goal in the middle of the field. Two attackers are moved to the left or right side of the field (see picture). A side player passes the ball to the last player, runs along the line, feints, and returns to receive a pass from the last player. The ball coming to him is immediately passed to the pivot who has freed up and moves towards the ball aiming to receive it back from the pivot for a shot. At the same time, the last player runs to the side where the side player was to receive a pass from the pivot and finishes the action with a shot. If he does not receive the ball back from the pivot (pivot passes with the sole), the side player runs to close the far post. The exercise is analytical, so we need to insist on the correct use of all technical elements.

**Variations:**
After attackers finish on one side, they take the ball and go into the column on the other side.
