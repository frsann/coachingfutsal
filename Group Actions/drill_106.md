# Drill 106

**Short description:**
Pivot play: running through. Three players start from the center.

**Objectives:**
Playing with the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Initial player positions: Player no.1 (the one who performs the run) takes the position of the central man in attack/defense. Player no.2 (the one who passes the ball to the pivot) is in the position of the right back. Player no.3 and the rest of the players (no.5, no.6, no.7) position themselves as the left back and have possession of the ball. Player no.4 takes the pivot position (when the ball reaches no.1, the pivot offers itself in the center and then spreads to the same side). Player no.3 (and the next one in his column) passes the ball to player no.1, waits for them to start a short run, and then covers, positioning themselves in place of player no.1. Player no.1 passes the ball to player no.2 "in two times," feints to spread out, then goes towards player no.2, receives a short ball from them, which is immediately forwarded to the pivot. The pivot, player no.4, receives the ball low, with their back turned to the opponent's goal, returns it to player no.1 who moves into a 1vs.G. Player no.2 makes 5-6 passes and changes position. Player no.1 after dribbling the goalkeeper stops in the pivot position. The pivot (no.4) after finishing the action stands in line behind player no.3. Note: The most important aspect of the exercise is the change of direction of player no.1. If performed with high intensity and at a well-chosen moment, and especially against teams that mark 1vs1, it allows us to open the center of the opponent's defense. The pass from player no.2 must be extremely accurate (towards player no.1, who approaches them after the feint). Otherwise, we risk the ball ending up in the possession of the opposing pivot.

**Variations:**
We will first perform the exercise on the right side, then on the left side. Encourage passers to use both feet when passing. The exercise is conducted on both halves of the field.
