**Progression:**
Strengthening the performance reliability of 2-3 player offensive tactical combinations (defense-breaking models) suitable for 4-0 offensive game systems, executed in both ends with a total of four execution locations, approximately 4 minutes per combination. Note: The goal of the exercise is also recovery from the previous game segment before the next one. • Wall pass on the wing: Base player's pass to the wing player, fake move to the center and turn to be playable, wall pass to the wing player, and scoring. Key points: the approach angle of the off-the-ball player for the wall pass, fake move • Overlapping: Base player's pass into attacking depth to the wing player who made a fake move, overlapping, foot sole drop to the player making the run or self-solution. Alternatively, a pass to a third (supporting the attack) player who plays a wall pass to the overlapping player. Key points: the first touch of the player attacking depth to the center to force the defender (see red) into lateral movement, reading the defender's movement • Three in line: Base player's pass to the wing player, wing player's drive towards the center and pass back, forming a three-line, base player's pass (a) to the wing player or (b) to the third player positioned behind the wing player and scoring. Key points: appropriate playing stance, explosive inclusion and transition of the wing player, communication between players to choose the decision-making model • Back Door Cut: Base player's pass to the wing player and back, short drive by the base player towards the wing and the wing player's calm space-making movement off the ball into attacking depth, based on the defender's (see red) guarding manner, either an off-the-ball wing player's (a) change of rhythm and attack behind the defender (back door) or (b) change of direction and cut to the center (Schumacher) to receive the ball

**Variations:**
Development: • Use of passive or ball-handling players forcing defenders (assistant coaches) into decision-making situations • The same combination at all performance locations for about 4 minutes, after which the combination is changed
