**Progression:**
4v4 on one goal with a goalkeeper. In a predetermined time period, one team constantly attacks while the other defends. With each interruption of the game, the coach throws a new ball into play. Two halves are played where each team takes turns playing defense and offense. Instructions: We can ask the attackers for specific offensive actions (e.g., breaking between the lines and parallel movement). From the defensive team, we can ask for specific defensive actions (jumps, strong side defense, guarding the pivot from the front).

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts.
