**Progression:**
Tactically, a 4vs4 is played on a 28x20 field, attacking 4 goals with 4 goalkeepers: two at the end line of the field and two placed on the halfway line. There are also 4 jokers, one on each side of the field. The game can be free or limited to two touches. The objective of the activity is to find the jokers on the sides of the field and receive from them to score a goal in one of the 4 goals. The joker must pass with one touch so that, also with one touch, the player on the field can score a goal. If two touches are made, whether by the joker or the receiver, the ball must be passed and a shot on goal is not allowed. The joker can also pass to another joker using two touches on the ball.
