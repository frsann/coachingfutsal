**Short description:**
Defense with substitutions. Real game on 20x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers.

**Objectives:**
Improvement of collective defensive aspects of Defense with substitutions, individual fundamentals, group concepts for the development of individual defense with opponent substitutions based on game reading, developing basic concepts of perception - decision-making.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
9 + gks

**Materials:**
T-shirts, balls

**Progression:**
Group defensive principles of 3 players... Switching marking, space control, defensive adjustments, pressure on the ball. Real play on 20x20, 3v3 + goalkeepers. If a goal is scored, the goalkeeper of the team that scored will initiate the new attack. We create 2 teams of three players with substitutions. Pressure on the ball, switching marking, covering the counter defender, defensive orientation under pressure on the ball (center), space control under pressure on the ball, adjustment of the first line of defense when the opposing player appears behind it on the opposite side of the ball, working on defensive triangles. Intensity when pressuring the ball, reducing the distance from the player receiving the ball during its trajectory. Quick positioning, preventing direct passing (goalkeeper to pivot). Individual positioning adjustment after a goalkeeper throw-in. Retreating if the first defensive line is breached. Attention to perceptual concepts important for decision-making in defense: the ball as a reference point, defensive orientation, defensive orientation of the player marking the opponent with the ball.

**Variations:**
Only the goal scored on the first attempt counts.
