**Objectives:**
Pass to the pivot, finish.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

2 series of 6 minutes.

**Number of players:**
12 Players + 2 Goalkeepers (2 players from each team, placed in the corners).

**Materials:**
Goalposts, balls, bibs.

**Progression:**
A 4 vs 4 is played on a 40 x 20 field with free touches (each team has two jokers in the corners). A goal can be scored without "connecting" with the pivot. If a player connects with one of the pivots with "one touch," the player who makes the pass must switch places and go to the place of their teammate. If a player connects with one of the pivots with "two touches," the pivot has two touches to assist their teammate, who is required to finish.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches for the attackers. Reward with a DOUBLE GOAL the goal scored by the "THIRD MAN" when playing with one of the pivots. Reward with a double goal (in far post actions).
