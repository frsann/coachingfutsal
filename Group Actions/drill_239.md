**Progression:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the right back. Simultaneously, the last player and the left back switch positions. The right back passes the ball to the last player, moves down the line, and suddenly cuts towards the left back. The last player passes the ball to the left back and spreads to the side, ready to run to close the far post. The right back positions himself in the middle, ready to execute a one-two pass. The left back passes the ball to the right back and runs down the line to receive a return pass (one-two pass). The right back completes the one-two pass with the left back and remains to cover the center. The left back shoots on goal or combines with the last player for the finish. After completing the attack, all three run to the center line, changing their initial positions in the process.

**Variations:**
Golman passes the ball to any one of the three players.
