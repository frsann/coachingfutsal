**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed shirts

**Progression:**
A match with three goals. Two teams consisting of 4 players each. The team playing defense has two players at the goals and two defenders in the field, making it a 2v4 situation in defense. If the defenders win the ball, they cannot score a goal but must pass the ball to one of the two goalkeepers, at which point their attack begins. The other team defends just one goal, so it plays defense 3v4. After a certain number of minutes, the teams switch sides.

**Variations:**
Allow pressing after losing the ball (if the ball doesn't go out). Limit attack time. Change the size of the field.
