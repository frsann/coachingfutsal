**Progression:**
Goal Scoring Exercise: Enhancing the execution reliability of 2-3 player offensive tactical combinations (defense-breaking models) suitable for a 4-0 attack play system, at two ends with a total of four execution spots, approximately 4 minutes per combination. Note: The aim of the exercise is also recovery from the previous game segment before the next one. • Wall pass on the wing: Pass from the base player to the wing player, a feint movement to the center and turning to be playable, wall pass back to the wing player, and goal scoring. Key points: angle of approach for the unball carrier for the wall pass, feint movement. • Overlapping: Pass from the base player to the wing player who has feinted a movement into attack depth, overlap, sole drop for the player making the overlap or own solution. Alternatively, a pass to a third player (who ensures the attack) who plays a wall pass to the overlapping player. Key points: first touch of the player attacking in depth to the center to prompt lateral movement from the defender (see red), reading the defender's movement. • Three in line: Pass from the base player to the wing player, wing player's dribble towards the center and pass back, forming a three-line, base player's pass (a) to the wing player or (b) to a third player positioned behind the wing player for goal scoring. Key points: appropriate ready position, explosive involvement and withdrawal of the wing player, communication between players to choose the solution model. • Schumacher / Back door cut: Pass from base player to wing player and back, short dribble towards the wing by the base player and calm space-making movement by the wing player in depth without the ball, based on the defender's (see red) guarding method either (a) a rhythm change and attack behind the defender (backdoor) by the unball carrier wing player or (b) a change of direction and cut to the center (Schumacher) to receive the ball. Development: • Use of passive or ball-carrying players forcing defenders (assistant coaches) into choice situations • The same combination at all performance spots for about 4 minutes, after which the combination changes.
