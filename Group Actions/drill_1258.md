**Progression:**
After the goalkeeper receives the ball from the passer (shot on goal, side pass), he hands it with his hand to one of two attackers who sprint to gain space towards the opponent's goal. The objective of the exercise is for the attacker who does not receive the ball from the goalkeeper to provide security to the attacker with the ball (cover him and be an option), positioning himself diagonally behind. Either attacker can finish the attack towards the other goal they are attacking.

**Variations:**
- the goalkeeper passes the ball by hand or foot to the attackers - passing to the goalkeeper can be from any position, on the ground, by shooting on goal, high or low ball, by hand, etc...
