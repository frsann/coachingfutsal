# Drill 2933

**Short description:**
Reduced game with 2 supports on the sides for overlaps. Supports only enter the game without the ball, in the overlap to the ball carrier.

**Objectives:**
Focus mainly on pair game routines (off-ball movements - overlaps) and attacking against low defenses (medium-range shooting).

**Area (mxm):**
1/2 Field

**Duration (min):**
2 minutes (4 sets)

**Number of players:**
8 + 2 FREE

**Materials:**
Balls and 4 vests.

**Progression:**
Organization: In 1/2 field, structure Gr + 2 + 2 supports on the sides x Gr + 2 + 2 supports on the sides. Reduced game Gr +2x2 +Gr, where the side supports can only enter without the ball to overlap teammates in play. After the overlap, the ball carrier will have 2/3 touches to decide (pass or shot) and will have to leave the field. If the overlap is made with the player who does not have ball possession to escape marking, the game continues as normal because the exchange does not interfere with it.

**Variations:**
We can alter countless rules, for example: entry of supports without the ball also with blind blocking, limit the number of touches, 3x3, etc... depending on your creativity and what you intend to instill in your teams' game.
