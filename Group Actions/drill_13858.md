# Drill 13858

**Short description:**
Ball possession 2v1 on 5x5 m. Two players try to pass the ball to each other as long as possible without the defender winning it.

**Objectives:**
Defensive fundamentals and types of defense. Understanding defensive basics for winning the ball and closing passing lanes. Learning to control the field of vision (the ball and the opponent without the ball). Understanding the use of defensive feints as a tool to confuse the attacker and facilitate winning the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, cones, high-visibility shirts

**Progression:**
Educational Unit: Individual Ball-Free Technique. Chapter: Beginnings. Content: Defensive feints. Closing passing lanes. Visual field control. Players divided into groups of three. One player plays defense while the other two try to pass the ball to each other as many times as possible on a 5x5 field. Free play. If the ball goes out of the square or the defender captures it during play, the player who made the mistake switches out. Increasing the playing space makes defensive actions more difficult, while reducing the number of touches makes attacking actions more challenging. The progression of this exercise goes from 2v1 to 3v2 and subsequently to various possession exercises with a larger number of players as children become aware of the team concept and collective work. Similarly, we can reduce the size of the square in a 2v1 possession situation and force the defender to act from outside the square while the attackers remain outside it. Ask players to perform feints with all parts of the body to confuse the passer and receiver along the potential passing line. Ask players to maintain a basic defensive position while moving, maintaining enough tension to successfully react to the attackerâ€™s movements. Control of the visual field.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the square.
