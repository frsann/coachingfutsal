# Drill 2941

**Short description:**
Reduced game with 2 supports on the sides for overlaps. Supports only join the game without the ball, overlapping with the ball carrier.

**Objectives:**
Primarily focus on pair game routines (off-ball movements - overlaps) and attack against low defenses (mid-range shots).

**Area (mxm):**
Half Field

**Duration (min):**
2 minutes (4 sets)

**Number of players:**
8 + 2 FREE

**Materials:**
Balls and 4 vests.

**Progression:**
Organization: In half the field, structure Gr + 2 + 2 supports on the sides x Gr + 2 + 2 supports on the sides. Reduced game Gr +2x2 +Gr, where the side supports can only enter without the ball in overlapping runs with teammates in play. After the overlap, the ball carrier will have 2/3 touches to decide (pass or shot) and must leave the field. If the overlap is done with the player who does not have possession to get rid of the marking, the game proceeds normally as the exchange does not interfere with it.

**Variations:**
We can change numerous rules, for example: entry of supports without the ball also with a blind block, limit the number of touches, 3x3, etc., depending on your creativity and what you want to instill in your teams' game.
