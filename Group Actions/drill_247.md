**Progression:**
The game is played 4 vs 4. High pressing is mandatory. Each team has one joker at the intersection of the central and sideline who holds the ball at their feet. When one attacker loudly shouts "ball," they can catch it with their hands. This activates the joker, who enters the field with the ball but cannot finalize, only assist. The player who caught the ball with their hands goes to the joker's position.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. A player can catch the ball with their hand after a certain number of passes. A Joker can enter the game only after passing the ball to a teammate. A Joker can enter immediately after taking the ball by hand from his teammate and can finalize.
