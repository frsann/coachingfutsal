**Short description:**
Defensive developments: Pressing and ball pressure

**Objectives:**
Correlation between ball pressure and pressing. Quick play. Development of the principle of width in attacking play.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
Repetitions of 3’-4’. You can perform 2 to 4 repetitions. Recovery depends on athletic goals.

**Number of players:**
8 outfield players: divided into 2 teams.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to define the teams. Cones: on each side of the field, set up small goals of 1 meter each; to create two finishing zones, 6 meters away from the baseline.

**Progression:**
Each team defends its two goals. The objective of the game is to score on the opponent's goals. The goal is only valid if the shot is taken from within the free zone (6 meters). The game resumes by placing the ball on the goal line; until the ball moves, opponents must remain 6 meters away (outside the scoring area). The team that scores the most goals wins the match.

**Variations:**
To increase the pace of the game, introduce touch limitations (e.g., 3 touches), or require both teams to execute full-field pressing. If the defending teams station themselves in front of the goal, implement the rule that every 10 passes results in a goal.
