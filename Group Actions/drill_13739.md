# Drill 13739

**Short description:**
3v3 on a 20x20 with the aim of, after making 2-3 passes, passing the ball to the pivot where a 2vs1 is played.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, deceiving opponent marking and playing in open space with quick transitions and defensive repositioning.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
An offensive team made up of 3 players + pivot + goalkeeper and a defensive team made up of 3 players + goalkeeper.

**Materials:**
Balls, branded T-shirts

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper must always make a short pass so that a 3 v3 starts on that half. Three attackers must pass the ball to each other at least 2-3 times before passing it to the pivot. The player who passes the ball to the pivot joins the attack, and his direct opponent plays defense against him and the pivot on the other side of the field. If the attackers don't score, the roles switch, and if they do score, the game continues in the same manner.

**Variations:**
After adding to the pivot, all players attack and all players defend. Defensive players need to prevent passing to the pivot, while attackers should constantly play between the lines and gain the backs of the defensive players.
