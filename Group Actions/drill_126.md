**Objectives:**
Play with Pivot

**Area (mxm):**
20 x 20

**Duration (min):**
2 series of 5 minutes

**Number of players:**
10 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Goals, Jerseys, Balls

**Progression:**
A 3 x 3 game is played with 3 touches. Each team has two pivots at the back of the court. The players inside can "connect with the pivot," and when they do, they must finish, either by the same player or another option (if they don't, it is considered a FOUL). They can also score without playing with the pivot. The pivot has two touches. When a team scores a goal, the goalkeeper of the team with ball possession starts the play.

**Variations:**
Do not limit the number of touches. Allow the goalkeeper to pass directly to the pivot. Only allow a goal when it connects with the pivot.
