# Drill 13770

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Activities like this are ideal for training a theme (that of minimal numerical superiority) with a base of 2 attacking players and therefore primary offensive collaborations, and doing so with many facets, prompted by numerous situations that the Game in its complexity proposes.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, it starts with a long goal kick from the goalkeeper, also practiced, to a pair of attackers on the other side of the pitch. They attack a pair of defenders who defend a goal placed at midfield, with the help of two wildcards, one on each side of the goal, who can touch the ball only once. In fact, once the two wildcards touch the ball as support for the 2vs2, they turn around, take a ball from the coach off the pitch, and attack the goal where the exercise started with the kick-off, against one defender, in 2vs1. The rotation will see the last person who touched the ball in the 2vs1 remain to defend the 1vs2; the two defenders become supports while the two attackers become defenders of the 2vs2. The other two wait in line for the goalkeeper's kick-off.
