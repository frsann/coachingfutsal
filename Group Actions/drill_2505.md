**Progression:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the right-back. Simultaneously, the last player and the left-back switch places. The right-back passes the ball to the last player, moves along the line, and suddenly turns towards the left-back. The last player passes the ball to the left-back and spreads to the side, ready to run and close the other post. The right-back blocks the opposing player who marks the left-back. The left-back cuts into the middle with the ball, taking advantage of his teammate's block. The left-back shoots at the goal or completes the play with the last player. The right-back covers the central part of the field. After the attack is completed, all three sprint to the center line, simultaneously changing to their initial positions.

**Variations:**
Golman passes the ball to any of the three players. After a fake block, the left and right defender can perform a combination on the same side.
