**Progression:**
The game is 2vs2 + one player to anticipate the counterattack. 2vs2 on half of the field. The third defensive player is positioned to anticipate the counterattack. One defensive player is on the other half of the field. If the two defensive players win the ball, they use the third teammate and execute 2vs1, as well as the goalkeeper when a shot is saved or the attack ends (the goalkeeper must therefore have many balls nearby or an assistant coach who provides them) to start the counterattack as quickly as possible. Attackers, when they lose the ball, can only play defense up to the halfway line. The defensive player not participating in the counterattack is substituted. Two attackers, after losing the ball, become defensive players. In 2vs1: the attacker who finishes the action and scores a goal exits, and the other attacker becomes the defensive player on that half. The defensive player (2vs1) who concedes a goal, after leaving the field, does 10 sit-ups. In 2vs1, after crossing the center, they have 10 seconds to finish the action. Player substitutions are made at the center.
