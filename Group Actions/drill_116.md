# Drill 116

**Short description:**
Adding on the diagonal pivot and shooting with the toe, working in 2 columns.

**Objectives:**
Game with the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Player No. 1 passes to No. 3, makes a feint, and shoots with the tip. Player No. 3 traps the ball with the sole and uses the same move to return the ball. As soon as No. 1 shoots at the goal, No. 2 starts, who then passes to No. 4, and so on. Player No. 1 stops at position No. 3, and No. 2 at position No. 4. Players No. 4 and No. 3 position themselves in line, exchanging their initial positions. Players must maintain a good rhythm in the exercise to train the goalkeepers effectively. Goalkeepers switch every 6 shots so that they have enough time to recover and remain constantly focused.

**Variations:**
Kicking with the toe, kicking with the laces, kicking with the inside.
