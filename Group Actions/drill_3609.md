# Drill 3609

**Short description:**
Pivot addition, shooting on goal.

**Objectives:**
Opening passing lanes for the pivot, shooting at the goal.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
We work in pairs + pivot. It involves scoring on both goals and on opposite sides. The pivot takes a position 6-7 meters from the opponent's goal in the middle of the field. Two attackers are shifted to the left or right side of the field (see picture). The side player passes the ball to the last player, moves along the line, feints, and returns to receive a pass from the last player. He immediately passes the approaching ball to the pivot who is free and moves with the intention of receiving it back from the pivot for a shot. At the same time, the last player runs to the side where the side player was to receive a pass from the pivot and finishes the action with a shot. If he does not receive the return ball from the pivot (pivotâ€™s sole pass), the side player runs to close the far post. The exercise is analytical, so we must insist on the correct use of all technical elements.

**Variations:**
After attackers finish on one side, they take the ball and go in a column to the other side.
