# Drill 1541

**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Attack and defense in situations of numerical disparity: 3 versus 2 and 2 versus 3 Exit situations from pressing. Concepts of counterattack.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
12 players divided into 2 teams: 5 outfield players and 1 goalkeeper per team.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
Each team positions the players in the following manner: 3 forwards in the offensive zone (opponent’s half), 2 defenders in the defensive zone (own half), and goalkeepers defend the goal. It is a regular match, except: forwards cannot go back to defense and vice versa, defenders cannot cross the midfield. In the offensive zone with a situation of 3 versus 2, play is limited to 2 touches, while in the defensive zone in a situation of 2 versus 3, play is with free touches. Rotate the players in all positions on the field. The team that scores more goals wins the challenge.

**Variations:**
To stimulate the completion of a counterattack, the action in the offensive zone should be concluded within a specific time frame (e.g., 10 seconds). To emphasize breaking out of pressing, the goalkeeper should be prevented from launching beyond the midfield; players in the defensive zone must advance the ball beyond the midfield within a certain number of passes (e.g., 5), etc.
