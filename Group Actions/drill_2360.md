# Drill 2360

**Short description:**
Source: Sergio Gargelli EXERCISE 166 (attack 3-1.pdf)

**Objectives:**
coordination 2 players and pivot defense of passing lines, creating superiority, reading the attackerâ€™s foot, reading attack orientation

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
8+ P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
2vs2 + PIVOT in a 12x10 space - connection with the pivot is mandatory, when the pivot receives, they finish 1vs goalkeeper - if the defenders recover, switch with the attacking pair and 1 defender becomes the pivot - if the attackers connect with the pivot, the same defenders continue defending - if the pivot scores, they remain the pivot, if not, one of the attacking pair (the one who passed to the pivot) replaces the pivot.

**Variations:**
Variant 1: The pivot can finish only with 2 touches, the passer to the pivot and his defender participate in the attack.  
Variant 2: Like variant 1 but only the other 2 can participate in the attack (the non-passer and his defender).  
Variant 3: Do it in a lateral position instead of central.  
Variant 4: Mandatory pass to the pivot along the ground or first touch.  
Variant 5: Introduce an active defender in advance who can only defend in a designated area (see figure 2).  
Variant 6: The pivot can receive behind the back or invade the defender's area, in this case, 3vs3.
