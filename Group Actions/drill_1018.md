# Drill 1018

**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Improvement of the game with the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
12 players: 2 goalkeepers, 5 forwards, and 5 defenders. In the central area, they play 3 on 3, while in the two lateral areas, they play 1 on 1; players must stay in their respective zones on the field.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs to define the teams. Cones: to mark the operating area of the pivot, 8 meters from the baseline.

**Progression:**
The exercise will take place with a 3 vs 3 in the central area of the field. The objective is to pass the ball to the pivot. The defender marks the pivot until they receive the ball. Once the pivot is in possession of the ball, they can: the pivot, having received the ball, goes to conclude in a 1 vs 1 (even with a limited number of touches or time: 4"). The challenge is won by whoever scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
In the pivot area, remove the defender, especially at the beginning of the themed game. The defender can enter the central zone to create a 4 against 3. Swap positions during the game among the various field positions. A teammate can come to assist the pivot, and in this case, the defender is activated, creating a 2 against 1 (here too it can be concluded within a time limit).
