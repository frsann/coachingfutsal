# Drill 88

**Short description:**
Warm-up: a game with 4 small goals each with 1 Joker behind the goal line.

**Objectives:**
Heating, addition

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
The exercise is done on half of the field. It is played 4vs4. Each team can score on two small goals. Behind the goals on the outer side of the field, there are two Jolly players who can move along the entire goal line. Let's imagine that players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are in possession of the ball. Their task is to pass the ball to player number 1 and score a goal on the return pass. We can require player number 1 to play with either the first or second touch. Also, players inside the field may have restrictions on the number of touches (free, two touches). Every 90 seconds, we change the players on the outer lines. It is useful for goalkeepers to participate in this game. In modern futsal, they are increasingly resembling field players.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches.
