**Progression:**
4v4 on one goal with a goalkeeper. During a specific time period, one team continuously attacks while the other defends. The coach introduces a new ball into play after each interruption. Two halves are played where each team plays both defense and attack. Instructions: We can ask the attackers for a specific offensive action (e.g., entering between the lines and parallel movement). From the defensive team, we can ask for specific defensive actions (jumps, strong-side defense, guarding the pivot from the front).

**Variations:**
Only a first-time shot counts.
