**Progression:**
2 teams consisting of 4+1 players each. Attackers can play across the entire field except within the outlined square (volleyball or basketball court). The defense can play across the entire field. As soon as the defense wins the ball, it must immediately take it out of the square if it was won within the square. There are also two Jokers (J and K) who operate with the attackers and cannot leave the outlined square, play with two touches, and can pass the ball to each other only twice. Jokers can also score a goal!

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Introduce penalties for a large difference in goals. Limit the attack time. Change the dimensions of the playing field.
