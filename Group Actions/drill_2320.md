**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
40x20

8 + 2P

**Materials:**

**Progression:**
Educationally, the game is free with the only limitation, given the division of players in each team into two colors, of always passing the ball to the opposite color in any situation. This limitation only provokes situations that a coach wants to work on: supporting the ball, useful movement for the ball carrier by those who cannot receive it at that moment, and the obligatory yet stimulating search for the third man for the player wearing the same color as the ball carrier.

**Variations:**
