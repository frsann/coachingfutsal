# Drill 104

**Short description:**
Diagonal exercise, 3 players in the center.

**Objectives:**
Practicing the attacking diagonal.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
All players.

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
Initial player positions: Player No.1 (the one who moves diagonally) takes the position of the central attacker/defender. Player No.2 (the one who passes the ball diagonally) is positioned as the right defender. Player No.3 and the rest of the players (No.5, No.6, No.7) position themselves as the left defender and have possession of the ball. Player No.4 takes the pivot position (when the ball reaches No.1, the pivot offers support in the center, then spreads to the opposite side and "closes" the far post). - Player No.3 passes the ball to Player No.1, Player No.1 passes the ball to Player No.2 and with a change of direction and rhythm moves diagonally. - Player No.2 moves the ball towards the center and passes it to Player No.1 who, after receiving the ball, goes 1vsG. - Player No.4 closes the far post. - Player No.3 covers after Player No.1’s movement and repeats the action from the new central position. - Player No.2 makes 3-5 passes and changes position. - Player No.1 stops at the pivot position (No.4), while the pivot (No.4) moves into the column to replace No.3. This rotation assumes perfect passing by Player No.2, but it’s equally important for Player No.1 to open up space diagonally after changing direction in order to receive the ball. This means he must watch his teammate and simultaneously be oriented towards the opponent's goal.

**Variations:**
We perform the exercise first on the right, then on the left side. It is done on both halves of the field. Goalkeepers combine warm-up at the goal with sit-ups and back exercises.
