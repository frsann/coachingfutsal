1 ball. Bibs: for defining teams.

**Progression:**
It is played 3 against 3, full court, with two jokers who play one touch with the team in possession of the ball. The jokers cannot score goals. A goal in the penalty area is worth 3 points, outside the area is worth 1 point. Defenders cannot enter their own penalty area. Attackers can enter the opponent's penalty area, one at a time and for no more than 4 seconds. Shots on goal must be first touch. There are no corner kicks; the ball always goes to the defense. The challenge is won by the team that scores the most points.
