**Progression:**
4v4 on one goal with a goalkeeper. During a set time period, one team constantly attacks while the other defends. At every stoppage of play, the coach introduces a new ball into the game. Two halves are played, with teams switching roles at the end of the first half. If the coach shouts "ball," he throws the ball from the center; if he shouts "1" or "2," then those players standing on the side behind the touchline introduce the ball when called. Key words: Defensive reorganization, concentration, intensity.

**Variations:**
Only a goal from the first attempt counts.
