**Number of players:**

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts

**Progression:**
Starting player positions: Player No.1 (the one going for a double pass) takes the position of the central attacker/defender. Player No.2 (the one who passes the ball short and seeks a double pass along the line) is in the right-back position. Player No.3 and the remaining players (No.5, No.6, No.7) position themselves at the left-back spot and have possession of the ball. Player No.4 takes the pivot position. Player No.3 (and similarly the next one in his column) passes the ball to player No.1, waits for him to start the double pass, then "covers" by positioning himself in player No.1's place. Player No.1 passes to player No.2 "in two steps," feints moving outward, then moves towards player No.2, receives a short ball from him, and with player No.2 executes a double pass along the line. Player No.2 passes a short ball to player No.1, seeks a double pass which is finished with a shot on goal. The pivot, player No.4, receives the ball with the sole of his foot, facing away from the opposing goal, returns it to player No.1 who starts a 1vs.G. After a goalkeeper dribble, player No.1 stops at the pivot position. The pivot (No.4) when the ball comes to No.1, offers in the middle, then spreads to the opposite side and closes the far post.

**Variations:**
We perform the exercise first on the right, then on the left side. Make passers use both feet when passing. It is done on both halves of the field. Goalkeepers combine warm-up at the goal with general mobilization exercises.
