**Area (mxm):**

**Number of players:**

**Progression:**
A relay of two teams arranged opposite each other (at a distance of 10-15 meters, for example) with balls placed halfway between the teams' positions. The number of balls matches the total number of players on both teams. At the coach's signal, the first player from each team runs to get a ball and dribbles it across the line that marks the start. The next teammate can start only when the previous one crosses that line with dribbling. The team that first transfers half of the balls to its side wins.

**Variations:**
Vary the team distance and the number of balls.
