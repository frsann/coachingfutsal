**Progression:**
All players with the ball are positioned on the goal line. One of the players without the ball is positioned on the center line. At the coach's signal, the players with the ball try to reach the goal line on the other side by dribbling, without being touched by the player who moves only along the center line (sideways movement).

**Variations:**
Vary the number of players without the ball. For example, two move along 10m lines while one along the central line so that players with the ball need to pass three obstacles. Vary the number of players without the ball and their position. For example, all three are on the center line. One moves along the line within the circle while the other two occupy part of the line laterally from the circle.
