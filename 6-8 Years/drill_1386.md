**Area (mxm):**
40x20

6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
The players, each with their own ball, are divided into two teams at the center of the field (approximately 1m apart). One team's task is to dribble the ball into the six-yard box, while the other's task is to prevent that (it is enough to touch the fleeing player). At the coach's signal (he loudly calls out the numbers, each pair has a number), one player runs away while the other chases him.

**Variations:**
Change the starting position of the player.
