**Progression:**
Let's divide the players into two teams. Each player has a ball. One team is fleeing, and the other is chasing. The chasing team starts the exercise positioned in the central circle, while the fleeing team is divided into two groups, each located in one of the two penalty areas. At the coach's signal, the chasers begin the chase, the prey flees, and both control and run with the ball. The team that catches more opponents within a given time period wins.

**Variations:**
Change the space and roles.
