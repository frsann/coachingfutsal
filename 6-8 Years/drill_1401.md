**Progression:**
Two teams of 3 players each compete in an area marked by three consecutive lines: the starting line (A), the line (B) where one defensive player is positioned, and the line (C) where two defensive players are positioned (the target line). Two attackers in possession of the ball start from line (A) and attempt to evade the defender from line (B) and cross it. After line (B), they are joined by one teammate, and all three together try to break through the defense of the two defenders from line (C) and score. Defenders can only play defense on the line they are on (lateral movement), and attackers can cross the line only by dribbling the ball, not by passing it over.

**Variations:**
Change the size (length and width) of the space.
