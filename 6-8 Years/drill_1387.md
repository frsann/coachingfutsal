At the coach's signal, the first player from each team runs with the ball around the square and returns with it to the starting point where they pass the ball to the next teammate. The last player of each team, after finishing dribbling, runs to the center of the square where a ball awaits them, which they throw out of the square, thereby bringing victory to their team.
