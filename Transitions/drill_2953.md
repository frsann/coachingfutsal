# Drill 2953

**Short description:**
2v2 continuation to 3v2 with a limited end time after the goalkeeper throws the ball. The player following the 3x2 action does not return.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to quickly finish at goal. Increase speed/accuracy when dribbling and passing the ball while moving and in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8-12 depending on needs

**Number of players:**
At least 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We position players as shown in the picture: 2v2 in each half plus goalkeepers, and possibly players behind the goal line who assist the goalkeepers to make the play as quick and high-quality as possible. Only attackers can play in the space between the two dashed lines. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the attackers in the attacking half. When the ball crosses the center, an additional attacker from the defensive half joins the attack. The attackers have 5 seconds to complete the action. The player who joined the 3v2 action does not return to their own half, but one of the other two attackers does, depending on their assessment. The goalkeeper starts a new play with a new ball, and we continue the sequence.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the time for completing the action. The coach determines which player returns to defense.
