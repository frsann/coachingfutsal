# Drill 2123

**Short description:**
While the caught attackers are serving their penalties, an attack begins with a surplus of players.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Numerical advantage.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts

**Progression:**
A regular game is played with multiple players. Every time the ball goes out for a goal-kick or the goalkeeper catches it, the defensive players have 4-6 seconds (the coach counts out loud) to catch (they need to touch and thus eliminate) the attackers. Whoever is caught must perform a penalty on the spot (push-ups, sit-ups, etc.) before returning to the game. The goalkeeper tries to quickly return the ball to play so his team can take advantage of the numerical advantage. Players serving the penalty do so on the field, thus representing physical obstacles for the attackers.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players. Change the dimensions of the playing field. A goal is only worth if scored directly.
