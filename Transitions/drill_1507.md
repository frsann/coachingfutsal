# Drill 1507

**Short description:**
Playing with an extra player while the opponent serves a penalty.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Playing with an advantage.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Arrange plastic circles off the field with a count one less than the number of players playing (e.g., 10 players, 9 circles, etc.). Two teams play a normal 5v5 match without a goalkeeper, allowing each player within 6 m to use their hands. Every time the ball goes out (no corners), all players must occupy one of the plastic circles. Whoever is left without a circle must do a few laps around the field (or several push-ups, sit-ups) while the others quickly resume playing so that one of the two teams always has a player advantage and tries to exploit it. The other team, having one less player, must hold out until their teammate returns after serving the penalty.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players and the size of the field.
