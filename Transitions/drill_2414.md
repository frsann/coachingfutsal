You start with a line of 3 players at the midline. The defending team has 2 players in defense at the ten-meter line of both halves and two players on the outside waiting at the midline. An assistant passes the ball to one of the 3 players on the midline, who decides with the first control which goal to direct the 3v1 transition + withdrawal. Once the 3v1 is completed, the 3 attackers will withdraw as the assistant will pass to one of the 2 defenders + the two incoming players on the field a ball for a 4v3 transition.
