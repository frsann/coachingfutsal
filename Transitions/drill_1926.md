**Progression:**
Education Unit: Defensive Basics. Stage: After technification. Content: Space control, field of vision control and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We create 2v1 situations on half the field until two players make at least six passes between them. Once this is achieved, the space is opened up for playing and attacking either of the two goals. Changing the direction of attack during finalization is not allowed. If attackers cross the center once, they cannot return to the other side and must complete their attacking action on that end. If the defender concedes a goal, they remain in defense for the new action. Create a competition. Ask players to: Read defensive orientation. Control space. Use basics such as timing and shading. Control the field of vision after correct basic positioning. Control body movements to avoid distorted peripheral vision.

**Variations:**
A goal from the start counts.
