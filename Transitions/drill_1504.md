The match consists of two teams made up of 5 players each.

After the 10m shot, two Yellow team players enter the field (the goalkeeper passes them the ball) and then they attack the other goal in a 2v1 situation where the defensive player is the one who just took the 10m shot (Phase B). At the end of the 2v1 action, the Red team attacks. Besides their player on the field, two more Red players enter to attack 3v2 on the other side. The defense consists of two Yellow players who were previously attacking 2v1 (Phase C). The next attack is again by the Yellow team in a 4v3 situation (Phase D). In the final action, the Red team attacks in a 4v4 setup (Phase E).
