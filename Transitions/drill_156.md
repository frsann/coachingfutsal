**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Counterattack development. Defense in outnumbered situations; attack in numerical superiority; quick transition from defense to possession phase.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
6 players: 2 goalkeepers, 3 forwards, and 1 defender

**Materials:**
Various balloons

**Progression:**
The game starts with the ball in the goalkeeper's hands, who then plays it in favor of their teammates, who must attack the opposing goal in a 3 versus 1 situation. The attackers must play with one touch. Once the play is over, the goalkeeper quickly passes the ball to the defender and calls out the name of one of the former attackers to create a 2 versus 2 situation where they try to attack the opposing goal, with no touch limit.

**Variations:**
A variation where, at the moment of the transition, the goalkeeper also participates in the attack, thus creating a 3 against 2 situation.
