**Short description:**
A 4v2 attack and a quick finish.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. 4v2 with a quick finish.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
In the playground (28x20 for example) two teams, each with 5 players, play a match with external passers. Players are arranged as follows: on the field, they compete 2v2 with goalkeepers. Outside the field, there are 4 players, two per team. The team in possession of the ball must call two of their teammates onto the field by passing them the ball before scoring a goal (so external players can enter the field and participate in the attack only after touching the ball). After the 4v2 attack, those who entered the game from outside the field position themselves to play defense, while those who were in the game take their places outside the field.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the playing field (28x20 for example).
