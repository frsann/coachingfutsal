# Drill 3363

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The activity proposed by Nitti has all the components to be comprehensive for the team, both from a tactical and game situation knowledge perspective, and from a physical perspective.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the game is played 3vs3 on a reduced field, with 3 players for each team acting as substitutes in certain positions on the field. The game is continuous, as there are no throw-ins or corners, but it restarts from the goalkeeper belonging to the team in possession of the ball. At the coach's whistle, every player, regardless of where the ball is (where it was left), must switch with a teammate who is off the field, and then resume the game with the continuity it had before.
