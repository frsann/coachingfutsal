Transitions - Depth, 40x20, two inverted goals at the center of the field.

**Objectives:**
Transitions - Depth.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20.

**Duration (min):**
2 series of 5 minutes.

**Number of players:**
8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, pinnies, cones, and goals.

**Progression:**
The red team plays as attackers in that area of the field (free play), and the blue team plays defense (two-touch play). In the other area of the field, the teams switch roles. When the defending team manages to complete 4 consecutive passes, they can move to the other field where they become attackers. If a team scores a goal, the goalkeeper puts the ball into play with the defending team.

**Variations:**
Do not limit touches. Everyone must be on the opposing field for the goal to be valid.
