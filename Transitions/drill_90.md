**Progression:**
Two attackers with one pivot in the middle of the field. Two defensive players playing pressing. Two more defensive players on the other half of the field. The goalkeeper cannot pass the ball to the pivot. After the goalkeeper passes to one of the attackers, they attempt to advance by playing 2vs2 or using the pivot, who can appear between the lines. Defensive players can only defend up to the halfway line and must try to play 2vs1 on the line whenever possible. When attackers, aided by the pivot, cross the center line of the field, they have 15 seconds to complete a 3vs2 action. The attacker who finishes the action goes to the pivot line, and the other two become defensive players and wait for the attack. The two defensive players from the beginning of the action become attackers. If defensive players steal the ball, they turn into attackers and, along with the pivot, try to score a goal, and those who lose the ball become defensive players. Player substitutions are made on the left side whenever they are not involved in action. A player who finishes the action and does not score a goal goes to the pivot line but as a penalty must do 10 sit-ups or push-ups.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches.
