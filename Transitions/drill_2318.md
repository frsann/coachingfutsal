# Drill 2318

**Short description:**
Continuation from 2v2 to 3v2 with limited time after the goalkeeper's throw. The player following the 3x2 action does not return.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we are in the position to quickly finalize at the goal. Increase speed/accuracy during dribbling and passing the ball while moving. Develop specific endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
from 8 to 12

**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
We position the players as in the photo. 2v2 on each field + goalkeepers and possibly players behind the goal line to help the goalkeepers make the action as fast and high quality as possible. Only the forwards can play in the space between two dashed lines. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the forwards in the opponent's half. When the ball crosses the halfway line, another forward from the defensive half joins the attack. The forwards have 5 seconds to complete the action. The player who joins a 3v2 action does not return to their half, but one of the other two forwards does, depending on their assessment. The goalkeeper starts a new action with a new ball, and we continue the sequence.

**Variations:**
Modify the number of touches. Change the time to complete the action. The coach determines which player returns to defense.
