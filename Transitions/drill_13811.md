# Drill 13811

**Short description:**
Transitioning from one half of the field to the other

**Objectives:**
Training counterattack and executing 3vs2 attack

**Area (mxm):**
40m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
15 minutes

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
In the center, we place 6-8 balls, and we give one ball to the attackers (3 blue) on one half of the field, who transition against 2 defensive players (2 yellow). On the other half, 2 attackers are waiting by the flanks (2 yellow) and 1 defensive player (1 blue). After the attack on the first half, 1 blue player and 1 yellow player each transition to the other half, forming a 3vs2 but now the yellow players are attacking, and the blue ones are defending. The yellow player transitioning to the attack phase takes a ball from the center. The exercise continues until all the placed balls are used up.

**Variations:**
- limit the number of touches
- limit attack time
- count goals scored to determine the winner
- play 3vs2 as possession

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
