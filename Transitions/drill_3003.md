# Drill 3003

**Short description:**
Transitions 2x1 to 3-4 field.

**Objectives:**
Transitions.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
All players (5+2)

**Materials:**
Balloons, little houses

**Progression:**
The 2 attackers (A and B) attack the goal defended by P2; defender 2 tries to hinder the opposing action. Once the action is over (the ball must leave the field of play), attackers 3 and 4 attack the goal defended by P1, in a 2 versus 1 situation, where the defender becomes the attacker who last played the ball in the previous action (in this example, player A). Essentially, continuous 2 versus 1 situations are generated, where the defender is always the last attacker who touched the ball.

**Variations:**
The player who concedes a goal remains to defend.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
