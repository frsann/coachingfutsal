We start with 1v1 on short goalkeeper passing and progress through 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, up to 4v4.

**Objectives:**
Working on counter-attacks, quick transitions, finishing, goalkeeper passes, openings, closing down the far post, pressing on the ball, defensive balance, and retreats.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
2-3 sets per team in even strength and power play situations.

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts

**Progression:**
On the field, we start with 1v1 on the goalkeeper's throw-in. Players, each team on one side, are positioned at the center outside the playing area and wait for their turn. As soon as the 1v1 finishes, the goalkeeper uses another ball to activate an attacker by passing him the ball for 2v1. After that, the goalkeeper who defended activates a teammate for 2v2 and so on from 3v2, 3v3, 4v3 to 4v4.

**Variations:**
A goal to the far post is worth double. A player entering cannot finish before his teammate touches the ball.

Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
