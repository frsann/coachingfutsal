**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Situations of numerical equality and inequality. Goalkeeper's throw. Retreat.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10’ to 20’. 2 series: all situations of equality and inequality.

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers, 2 teams of 4 players.

**Materials:**
Various balls. Bibs to define the teams

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to a teammate who starts a 1-on-1 situation. Once the play is over, the other goalkeeper immediately puts the ball back into play in a 2-on-2 situation. Once finished, they move to a 3-on-3, and end with a 4-on-4. The same applies to numerical superiority. It starts with a 2-on-1 and ends with a 4-on-3. For plays with numerical equality, it must be concluded within a set time: 12 seconds. Progressions: Equal numbers 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4; Unequal numbers 2x1, 3x2, 4x3.

**Variations:**
The goalkeeper can immediately throw deep, so the attackers need to worry about dropping back and preventing the long throw.
