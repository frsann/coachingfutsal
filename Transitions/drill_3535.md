**Materials:**


**Progression:**
- The goalkeeper must serve (by foot or hand) the 2 players beyond the halfway line, with the 2 who can try to intercept. If the ball does not reach its destination properly, it will be served by the goalkeeper from the same field. At that point, a 2vs2 begins to get out of the pressing. If the defense intercepts, a quick 2vs2 starts to finish. If the ball passes to the other half of the field, one of the 2 players accompanies the action, which becomes a 3vs2. As soon as it ends, the goalkeeper will relaunch the ball to perform a 2vs1 in the other half of the field. WE COUNT THE GOALS SCORED.
