# Drill 1803

**Short description:**
2v2 continuation to 3v2 with a limited time finish after the goalkeeper's throw. The player following the 3x2 action does not return.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to quickly finish at the goal. Increase speed/accuracy when dribbling and passing the ball while moving and in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on needs"

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We position the players as in the picture. 2v2 in each half + goalkeepers and possibly players behind the goal line who assist the goalkeepers to make the action as quick and high-quality as possible. In the area between the two dashed lines, only attackers can play. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the attackers in the attacking half. When the ball crosses the center, another attacker joins the attack from the defensive half. The attackers have 5 seconds to finish the action. The player who joined the 3v2 action does not return to their half; instead, one of the other two attackers does based on their assessment. The goalkeeper starts a new action with a new ball, and we continue the sequence.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the time for completing the action. The coach determines which player returns to defense.
