**Progression:**
Educationally, the players are divided into groups of three and start one after the other from a gate. The goalkeeper will pass the ball to the first in line. This player will leave it with the sole of the foot for the following player, who will do the same for the last in line. The player in the middle will be the one defending the 2vs1; the first player will be the one trying to gain depth; the last player will be the one pushing the counterattack. Subsequently, the player who last touches the ball will be the one defending the 2vs1 from the other side. The two attacking players in the second part will move to a wider position to receive the opening from the goalkeeper and then push the counterattack.
