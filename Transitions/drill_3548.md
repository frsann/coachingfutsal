**Progression:**
The game starts with 3v3 on a 28x20m field. When the goalkeeper sends the ball to the striker, the pivot enters the game from behind the goal line to create a 4v3 situation. After the action is completed, we start again from the goalkeeper on the opposite side using the same principle. The attacker who last touched the ball leaves the game. The goalkeeper cannot play directly to the pivot.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of presses to attack. Limit the time to attack. Start the game with 1v1 or 2v2. One player goes out as agreed between the players or called by the coach. The goalkeeper can play to the pivot.
