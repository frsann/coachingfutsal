# Drill 3546

**Short description:**
Countering 3v2 press

**Objectives:**
3vs2 and 2vs3

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
2 teams with 4 players + 1 goalkeeper and reserves

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Goal pass to get out of pressing 2-2. Passing can be to the other side of the playing field or to your own side.If the goalkeeper passes to a player in his own half, a third player can be added to the attack as support on the flank or between the lines in the middle.When the ball passes to the other side, 3vs2 is realized, so one player is added to the other side.It can be one of the two yellow players who passes the ball over the center or any of the two yellow players if one of the red players (striker from the other side of the field) participates in the maneuver in his own half.If the defensive players of the first line win the ball, they have to pass it to the same goalkeeper and thus switch roles, they become attackers.When the ball crosses the half of the field and is won by the defenders, they should pass it to their goalkeeper and thus turn into attackers.In this case, the third attacker, who becomes a defensive player by losing the ball, must retreat to his half of the field as soon as possible and thus prevent the situation of 1 yellow vs two attackers or even 1vs3 if the goalkeeper quickly transfers the ball to the other half, to which the third attacker can be added .Goalkeepers have, as in a real game, 4 seconds to make a pass.
