# Drill 3678

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
I propose a training exercise adapted from 11-a-side soccer.

The players are divided into 2 teams and the structure involves the use of 3 goals, one central and two lateral on the opposite side.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The game situation begins with the ball being thrown by the goalkeeper to one of the 3 opponents positioned beyond the halfway line. During the time of the throw, the most advanced player of the three defenders will sprint to a predetermined point (line, cone, marker, coach) to then perform a defensive recovery. The three players pushing the positive transition must aim to close the transition as quickly as possible. If the defensive recovery is quick and effective, the game will continue as a 3vs3. At the end of the 3vs2 (and possible 3vs3), two players from the defending team will enter the field to conduct and play 2 one-on-one duels. Therefore, two players from the team that previously executed the positive transition must be quick to pressure the ball and face the opponents. A third duel will be played towards the main goal with the remaining third player from the attacking transition team and one of the three players who defended the transition.

**Variations:**
CASTELLANA'S PROPOSAL: if there is a goal in the 3vs2, in the duels I let the scorer attack, otherwise the defender.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack - Exit Pressing, Technique - 1v1, Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
