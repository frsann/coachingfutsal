# Drill 13804

**Short description:**
Exercise to do when we have many players.

**Objectives:**
transitions  
decision making  
high intensity

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
16 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Two teams of 6 players each: BLACK and RED. Plus 4 YELLOW pivots positioned at opposite corners as shown in the figure. The reds start with a player (holding a ball in hand) who conducts another ball to the center of the field to then serve the opposite black player, who can choose whether to pass the ball to one side or the other teammate to generate a full-field 3vs3 where any goal can be attacked (on the first attack). Once the action is finished (regardless of the outcome), the red player with the ball in hand puts it down and must serve one of the 2 pivots in the corners. At that point, a 4vs4 is formed because the X who received the ball from the red will become part of the reds, while the X on the opposite corner will become part of the blacks, who will likely need to initially defend a 4vs4. This way, we will have involved 8 players. As soon as it's over, another 3vs3 plus 2 pivots will start. COUNT THE GOALS!

**Variations:**
Decide how and when you can attack the other goal.
