# Drill 2955

**Short description:**
We start with 1v1 on short goalkeeper passing and then move to 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, up to 4v4.

**Objectives:**
Work on counterattacks, quick transitions, finishing, goalkeeper distributions, positioning, covering the far post, pressing on the ball, defensive balance, and retreating.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
2-3 sets per team in numerical equality and numerical advantage

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
On the field, we start with a 1v1 from a goalkeeper's throw-in. Players, each team on one side, are positioned at the center outside the field and wait for their turn. As soon as the 1v1 finishes, the goalkeeper, with another ball, activates an attacker by passing the ball for a 2v1. After that, the goalkeeper who defended activates a teammate for a 2v2 and so on, from 3v2, 3v3, 4v3 to 4v4.

**Variations:**
A goal to the far post is worth double. A player who enters cannot finish before his teammate touches the ball.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
