# Drill 3431

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The activity proposed by Sylvio Rocha falls into those specific and functional for an aspect of the Game, which in this case are asymmetries, numerical superiorities, and inferiorities.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
As can be seen from the video, there is a team that positions 3 players on the midfield line who receive a pass from their teammate on the sideline. The player in the center will choose which side to attack with the 3, while the player who makes the pass will go to defend on the opposite side. The team with one player on each side will defend a 2vs3 asymmetry on the side where the 3 are attacking, because on the opposite side there will be a teammate who will become the second defender; on the opposite half of the field, the player already positioned will be the off-ball attacker in a 2vs1, because behind the player who made the pass to midfield and went to defend, there will be a teammate with the ball who will create the 2vs1.

**Variations:**
The activity can be made competitive by assigning points to those who score goals, or alternatively to those who defend if the focus is to be on defense. Additionally, more value could be given to the offensive 3vs2 and the defensive 1vs2. In short, the coach has great capacity for impact by managing this activity.
