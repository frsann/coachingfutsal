**Progression:**
Two teams of 5 players each. Each team consists of 3 players in the attacking half and two in the defensive half. The game is played 2v3 on each half of the field, with the intention to cross into the attacking half as quickly as possible. Only three defensive players in the attacking half can intercept the goalkeeper's pass, but not the two in the defensive half. - If one of the three players from the attacking half returns the ball to a teammate in the defensive half, they can join their teammates in the attacking half, creating a 4v2 attack. The attack must be completed within 15 seconds. - To make it easier to break out of pressing, one attacker from the attacking half can join the two attackers in the defensive half, turning the 2v3 into a 3v3. - When the ball crosses into the attacking half, one attacker from the defensive half can join teammates in the attacking half, creating a 4v2. After the finalization, they return to their section of the field. Every successful direct pass from the goalkeeper to a teammate in the attacking half is worth 1 point. Every goal scored at the far post is worth 2 points. A regular goal is worth one point. Every good save by the goalkeeper is worth 1 point. Every foul that prevents a goal from being scored is worth -1 point.

**Variations:**
Only a first-time goal counts.
