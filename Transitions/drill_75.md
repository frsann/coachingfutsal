# Drill 75

**Short description:**
3vs2 counterattack with pressing.

**Objectives:**
3vs2 and 2vs3

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
2 teams with 4 players +1 goalkeeper and substitutes

**Materials:**
Balls, marked t-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Goalkeeper pass to escape pressing 2-2. The pass can be to the other side of the field or to one's own side. If the goalkeeper's pass is to a player on their own half, a third player can be added to the attack as support on the flank or between lines in the middle. When the ball crosses to the other side, it results in a 3vs2, so one player is added to the other side. It can be one of the two yellow players who carry the ball across the center or any of the two yellow players if a red player (the attacker from the other side of the field) participates in a maneuver on their own half. If the first line defensive players win the ball, they must pass it back to the same goalkeeper and swap roles, becoming attackers. When the ball crosses the half line of the field and if the defensive players win it, they must pass it to their goalkeeper and turn into attackers. In that case, the third attacker, who becomes a defensive player upon losing the ball, must retreat to their own half as quickly as possible to prevent a situation of 1 yellow vs two attackers, or even 1vs3 if the goalkeeper quickly transfers the ball to the other half, to which a third attacker can be added. Goalkeepers have, as in a real game, 4 seconds to make a pass.

**Variations:**
In order to bring an attacker from the other half of the field to their own side, the two yellow attackers must make at least one pass between them.
