**Progression:**
A real 4v4 game on a 40x20m field. The player who last touches the ball must sit on the field and remains sitting until the ball crosses the center. Meanwhile, a counterattack begins. The game continues as 4v3, and when the ball crosses the center, it's 4v4 again, and so on.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches. Limit the time for a 4v3 counterattack. The player sitting can start on the coach's signal. The player called out by the coach must sit on the field. The player called out by the opposing goalkeeper must sit on the field.
