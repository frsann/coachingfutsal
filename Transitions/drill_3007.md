# Drill 3007

**Short description:**
3 versus 2 transitions on goalkeeper throw-ins.

**Objectives:**
Transitions.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
All the players (6+2)

**Materials:**
Balloons, houses

**Progression:**
The 2 defenders (2 and 3) must try to intercept the goalkeeper's ball, staying within the area defined by the 10-meter line and the midfield line. The 3 attackers, upon receiving the ball, attack in a 3 against 1 format towards the goal defended by P1, 4, and 2 and 3 rushing back. Once the play is over, the last attacker who touched the ball goes to defend, and the other 2 try to intercept the ball, while the one who was defending switches to attack. If the defenders intercept the ball thrown by the goalkeeper, both of them attack the goal he was protecting.

**Variations:**
Limitation of ball touches; number of passes within which a goal must be scored; finishing the transition within a set time.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
