# Drill 2867

**Short description:**
3v1 in each half of the field. When the ball crosses the midfield, a player from the defensive team transitions to turn the play into 3v2.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to quickly finish on goal. Increase speed/accuracy when dribbling and passing the ball while moving, especially in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We start 3v1 in each half of the field from the goalkeeper's pass. When the ball crosses the halfway line, a player from the defensive team moves in to turn the play into 3v2. Once the play is finished, the player who didn't fall back follows the next attacking play on the pass from their goalkeeper. Organize the balls so the goalkeeper can quickly initiate plays.

**Variations:**
Limit the time for the attack. A goal only counts from the first attempt.
