# Drill 2899

**Short description:**
We are uploading a task back to this task bank we are creating little by little. In this case, we are uploading a task that can aim at completions and working on superiorities in a situation quite close to reality.

**Objectives:**
Finishes and the work on superiorities in a situation quite close to reality.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
This task is organized from a 2v2 structure in each half of the field, meaning from a "real" situation with two teams divided into two pairs (one in the offensive half and the other in the defensive half). The ball is put into play in the defensive half for that team to break out of pressure, and it is played using the typical dynamics of this structure where the defensive pair must connect with the attacking pair, and the latter must finish to score a goal. However, in this task, superiority situations will arise based on various guidelines that we will introduce:

**Variations:**
- The first rule is that when the defending pair connects with the attacking player, the direct defender of the player receiving the ball must automatically move out and change sides, and it should be one of the attack field teammates who falls back to defend the 2v1 that is generated.
- The second rule is that if the defender manages to anticipate the pass we discussed in the first option, a 3v2 situation will be created in the attack field.
- The third rule, combining the concept of the previous option, is that if one of the two players from the defensive field manages to move to the attack field while dribbling, a 3v2 will also be created.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack - Exit Pressing, Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
