**Short description:**
Collective tactics

**Objectives:**
Exit from pressing, ball possession, play towards the pivot, fast transition, retreat.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10 to 15 minutes

**Number of players:**
12 players: 2 goalkeepers, 5 forwards, and 5 defenders. In the defensive zone, we will have a 3 versus 3, in the offensive zone 2 pivots and 1 defender.

**Materials:**
1 ball, bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper cannot play the ball beyond the halfway line; they must play short. To pass the ball to the pivot, all attackers must touch the ball. The player who passes the ball to the pivot can accompany the play, and their direct opponent can also mark them. The play ends in a 3 versus 2 situation. The last player to touch the ball exits the field, and the player out enters, restarting the themed game. The challenge is won by the team that scores the most goals.

**Variations:**
Introduce limits on ball touches.
