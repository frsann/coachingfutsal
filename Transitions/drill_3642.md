**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
There are activities that may seem the same as others, just because the trained moment is the same and because the way in which the activity is conducted might also be similar. However, there are details, or starting points, starters, or ways of reaching that indicated moment, that make the goal achieved by the activity completely different.

**Progression:**
Tactically, a 3vs2 is played continuously. Players can be divided into 2 teams in such a way that the asymmetrical plays involve two groups of always the same players, to make the activity competitive. After an initial 3vs2, the 3 attacking players must defend their own goal on the other side against the 2 who have just defended and against a third player entering from the halfway corner. There won't be 3 defending because the player entering from midfield will call the name of one of the attackers who will leave the field and cannot participate in the defensive action. The player entering will call the name of who exits, as they aim to create and exploit an advantage. However, the key detail that will make a difference is that the player entering from midfield will put the ball into play for the 3vs2, and they will do so by necessarily passing the ball backward. This is a crucial detail for the development of the 3vs2 and for the vision of the advantage that the entering player must create, which should not be instantaneous.

**Variations:**
In order for the workload to be more or less similar for everyone, it is necessary for those outside preparing to enter to be focused on the exercise so as not to leave someone on the field for too long. If we then want the activity to be even more challenging and we want to assign a score, it might be best for the coach to call in the player from outside, otherwise, they tend to bring out the best player(s).
