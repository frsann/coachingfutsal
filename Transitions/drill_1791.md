# Drill 1791

**Short description:**
4v4, the third group of four waits outside to be activated by a pass.

**Objectives:**
Work on defensive retreat, attacking transitions, counterattacks, finishing, covering the far post, pressing the ball, defensive balance, and retreats.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed t-shirts

**Progression:**
3 teams of 4 players each with goalkeepers. The game is played 4v4, either freely or with two touches. If the attacking team of four is in trouble, they can pass the ball to one of the four players waiting outside the field, positioned according to the diagram. When this happens, the team of four that received the ball enters the field and tries to use the positional advantage to score, while the team of four that passed the ball takes their place. The team that enters attacks the same goal on which the team that passed them the ball was attacking.

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts. Allow an attack on both goals when the ball reaches the team waiting outside.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
