# Drill 2521

**Short description:**


**Objectives:**
The exercise is designed to train transitions in both phases, trying to stay as close as possible to the conditions of the competition.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
4 minutes for 3 sets, 2 minutes rest between each set

**Number of players:**
12 + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The starting point is the goalkeeper's throw with their hands (you can also decide here the level of difficulty to give the goalkeeper, with 1 or 2 defenders on the throw) to then develop into a 2vs1 towards the same; upon regaining the ball or after finishing, it immediately turns into a 3vs2 towards the opposite goal. As soon as the 3 attackers are about to cross the midfield, the goalkeeper initiates another 2vs1, creating continuity that, with 4 groups of 3 outfield players and a recommended step from 4 to 6 minutes, will be a good endurance strength training.
