**Progression:**
The game is played on half a field. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the four attackers. The game is played with a two-touch limit. A goal is valid only by shooting with one touch. There is no final pass. The defenders can only intercept if they disrupt the play. The last two who touch the ball stay on defense, except for when a goal is scored, where the defending pair remains. If the attackers make only one pass, only the person who touched the ball stays on defense, resulting in a 4 against 1 situation.
