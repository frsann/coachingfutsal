**Progression:**
Educational unit: Development of counterattack. Content: Technical and tactical fundamentals. Peripheral perception of the environment in situations of numerical disadvantage and equality. Group technical-tactical means. We start with 2v2 on a basketball court and three substitutes per team positioned behind the goal line. The game is constantly 2v2, and whoever loses the ball must be replaced by a teammate waiting to be activated. In this way, we constantly play 2v1 with another defender arriving to assist in retreating. We play two sets of 2-3 minutes each. We do two more sets of 2-3 minutes with 2 substitutions per team playing 3v2 '1 coming to help. Finally, we perform 2 sets of 2-3 minutes in 4-4 with one substitution per team. Emphasize the fastest possible transition. Decision-making when initiating a counterattack. Definitely avoid losing the ball during the transition in numerical advantage.
