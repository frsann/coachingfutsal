**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Play 4v4 on a 20x20m field with 2 goalkeepers and one passer per team located on the opposite line from their teammates. (see image) The game starts with the passer of one team and we have situations: 1vGK, 1v1, 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, 4v4. Players can score in any goal and can change direction whenever they wish. Once the ball is in play, no one else can enter the field until the ball is out of play or a goal has been scored. A passer can play the ball to any player on the field. After the 4v4 action, the first round ends and we start a new round with the passer from the second team.

**Variations:**
Players can score a goal only when everyone touches the ball. The goal in 4vs4 is worth 2.
