**Objectives:**
Concepts of the counterattack 3 against 2. Delaying and retreating. Save in a situation of inferiority, for the goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
8 players: 2 goalkeepers, 3 forwards, and 3 defenders

**Materials:**
Various balloons

**Progression:**
Three attackers are positioned above the halfway line; two defenders are below the midfield line, and a third is at the edge of the penalty area; the goalkeeper defends the goal. The attacker receives the ball and attacks the goal in a temporary 3 versus 2 situation; when the ball handler makes the first move, the defender on the edge of the penalty area can go to defend. The arrival of the third defender will prompt the attackers to complete the play as quickly as possible, aligning with the typical timing of a counterattack situation. The play continues until the ball goes out of the field.
