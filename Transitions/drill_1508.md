# Drill 1508

**Short description:**
While the caught attackers serve penalties, a power play begins.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Numerical advantage.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6-10

**Number of players:**
All the players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
A regular game is played with multiple players. Each time the ball goes out of bounds or the goalkeeper catches it, the defending players have 4-6 seconds (the coach counts out loud) to catch (they need to touch and thus eliminate) the attackers. Those caught must perform a penalty (push-ups, sit-ups, etc.) before returning to the game. The goalkeeper tries to quickly return the ball to play so that his team can exploit the numerical advantage. Players executing the penalty do so on the field, thus acting as physical obstacles for the attackers.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players. Change the dimensions of the field. A goal only counts on the first attempt.
