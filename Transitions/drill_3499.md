**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, a goal is placed on the half-field line and this is used along with the opposite goal from where the players start. There is a goalkeeper in each goal, and from the further one, a pass is made to the feet of one of the two players, while the defending player does so with a ball in hand. The receiver, along with a teammate, attacks in a 2vs1 towards the goal on the half-field line. If a goal is not scored, the player who defended the 1vs2 asymmetry places the ball on the ground and pushes in a 1vs1 towards the other goal, while the player who last touched the ball will go to defend. If a goal is scored in the 2vs1, the defending player leaves the ball for the player who last touched it and goes on to defend the 1vs1 situation towards the other goal.
