# Drill 74

**Short description:**
2vs1 pro tune-up with realistic withdrawal.

**Objectives:**
Transitions 2v1 and 1v2.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts

**Progression:**
The game is played 2v1. If the defense gains possession of the ball, they can either pass it to the attackers on the other side or return it to their goalkeeper, who quickly distributes it to the attackers on the other side. At the moment one of the attackers touches the ball, one of the jokers (in order) enters the game to help in defense, turning the 1v2 situation into 2v2 if they arrive in time. If the ball goes out, the goalkeeper quickly throws it to the attackers on the other side of the field, while the attackers from the previous action (2v1) swiftly retreat towards the center, and the joker moves to the center line waiting for their turn. If the goalkeeper saves a shot or the attack ends with a goal, the same happens. Jokers work on a timed basis.

**Variations:**
Change the dimensions of the playground.
