# Drill 3362

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The training of a primary collaboration, both offensive and defensive, placed in a context that leads to a transition elaborated on a real situation. All of this is what emerges from this activity by Beso that aims to put into a real moment everything that can surround a combination of two players, both offensively and defensively.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, a 2vs2 is played on half the field with two attackers and two defenders on the halfway line: the attackers are in the corners of one half, while the defenders are in the center. Once the 2vs2 is over, the last attacker who touched the ball, in any way, must touch the post before returning to defend. The other two players who were defending the 2vs2 will push the transition, having as their only defender in their half of the field the player who was attacking the 2vs2. They can use two other teammates but must face two more defenders in the other half.
