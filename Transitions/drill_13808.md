# Drill 13808

**Short description:**
Transitions 4v2 and 4v3

**Objectives:**
Improving decision-making when we find ourselves in the final phase. The goal is to increase speed and accuracy during management and play during movement, and in the final phase. Improving the defensive aspect of delay and slowing down the attack. Developing specific endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
"8 + 2 goalkeepers minimally"

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
Four attackers are lined up along the goal line, and four defenders are positioned opposite them at a distance of 6 meters. The goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers who initiates the play. At the moment the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers, a 4v2 transition starts with recovery. If the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the central attackers, two central defenders start the recovery (they must touch the goal line as quickly as possible and return to assist the defense), or if the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the side attackers, two side defenders start the recovery. The attacker who last touched the ball on the opposite side must touch the goal line before a 4v3 counter-attack begins.

**Variations:**
- Changing the distance of defensive players from the line
- Changing the size of the field
- Introducing time limits for attacks

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
