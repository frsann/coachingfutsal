# Drill 3501

**Short description:**
Start from a phase of ball possession and then develop a dynamic of counterattack or negative transition.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, transitions

**Area (mxm):**
20x10 + two doors

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
Minimum 7 + two goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Flat hats, balls

**Progression:**
Didactically, a 3vs3 + 1 joker is played in a 20x10 area in the midfield zone. The joker is always used to favor ball possession, to promote team self-confidence dynamics. Once 4 consecutive passes are achieved, the team in possession of the ball can decide to attack either of the two goals without the joker's help. The possession dynamics may lead to an interception by the defenders, who at that point must make a pass within the designated possession area before attacking one of the two goals. There may also be a ball lost by the team in possession, ending up in areas of the field not designated for possession. In this case, it will be the team that was defending that recovers the ball and starts a new possession phase in the 20x10 area.

**Variations:**
Number of jokers, how many players transition, use more space and only one goal.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
