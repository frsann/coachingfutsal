**Progression:**
Two attackers start in a 2x2 against two defenders and must complete the play within a limited time (e.g., 6 seconds or they must conclude in 4 passes). As soon as the action is completed, the third attacker brings the ball onto the field to create a 3x2. The player conceding the goal remains defending, and the last two players who touched the ball stay to defend.
