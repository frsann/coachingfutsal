**Short description:**
2v1 warm-up game including a transition

**Objectives:**
Warm-up and activation for upcoming exercises

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
Everything

**Materials:**
Balls, vests, goals, cones

**Progression:**
- The goalkeeper opens to the other half of the field to their teammates who try to win a 2v1+gk situation. 
- From the goal, it's the other team's turn to attack.
- If the defending team wins the ball, it's immediately played to their teammate in the midfield, initiating a 3v2+1 attack on the other end. (Meaning two new players from the middle and those already on the field!)
- If the defending team in the 3v2+1 situation wins the ball, the play continues, and then the same game starts from the other end.
- Rotate player positions so that everyone takes on a defensive role in a 2v1 situation.
