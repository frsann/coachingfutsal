**Progression:**
Play 4v4 on a 20x20m pitch with 2 goalkeepers and a passer for each team who are positioned on the line opposite to their teammates. (See image) The game is started by a passer from one team and we have situations: 1vGK, 1v1, 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, 4v4. Players can score in any goal and can change direction whenever they wish. Once the ball is in play, no one else can enter the field until the ball is out of play or a goal is scored. A passer can play the ball to any player on the field. After the 4v4 action, the first round ends and we begin a new round with the passer from the second team.

**Variations:**
Players can only score a goal when everyone touches the ball. The goal in 4vs4 is worth 2.
