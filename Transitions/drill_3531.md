# Drill 3531

**Short description:**
Transitions 4v2 and 4v3 on 40x20.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to quickly finish on goal. Increase speed/accuracy when dribbling and passing the ball while moving in the final third. Improve the defensive aspect of delay and slowing down the attack. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
We line up 4 attacking players along the goal line. (see picture) Opposite them, at a distance of 6 meters, we line up 4 defenders. (see picture) The goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers who initiates the action. At the moment the goalkeeper passes the ball to an attacker, a 4v2 transition with recovery begins. If the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the two central attackers, the two central defenders start their recovery (they must touch the goal line as soon as possible and return to help the defense). If the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the wing attackers, the two wing defenders start their recovery. The attacker who last touches the ball on the opposite side must touch the goal line before starting a 4v3 counterattack.

**Variations:**
Change the distance of the defensive players from the line. Change the size of the field depending on the needs. Introduce a time limit for the attack.
