**Progression:**
Tactically, players are divided into groups of three and start one after the other from a gate. The goalkeeper will pass the ball to the first in line. This player will leave it with the sole for the following player, and they will leave it in the same way for the last one in line. The player in the middle will be the one defending the 2vs1; the first player will try to gain depth; the last player will drive the counterattack. Subsequently, the player who touches the ball last will be the one defending the 2vs1 on the other side. The two attacking players in the second part will take a wider position to receive the opening from the goalkeeper and then drive the counterattack.
