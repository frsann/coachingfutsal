# Drill 3554

**Short description:**
3v1 in each half of the field. When the ball crosses the midfield, a player from the defensive team moves to turn the action into 3v2.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations where we need to quickly finish at the goal. Increase speed/accuracy while dribbling and passing the ball when moving and in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
A minimum of 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We start 3v1 in each half of the field from the goalkeeper's pass. When the ball crosses the middle of the field, a player from the defensive team crosses to turn the action into 3v2. When the action is completed, the player who didn't retreat follows the next attacking action on their goalkeeper's pass. Organize the balls so the goalkeeper can quickly start the actions.

**Variations:**
Limit the time for the attack. The goal only counts from the first attempt.
