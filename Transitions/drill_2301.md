**Progression:**
It begins with a penalty kick for a red player who then has to run and touch one of the two posts, while the goalkeeper plays the ball to start the 2vs1 (someone must quickly serve the goalkeeper) plus the red player who tries to recover. Once that's done, the red team's goalkeeper will put the ball back into play for the 3vs2. If the Reds steal the ball, the same ball is used. Subsequently, a 3vs3 will start. Perform various series by alternating roles.
