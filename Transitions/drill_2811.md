**Progression:**
The game will always start with the goalkeeper's throw-in. The team in possession of the ball has the option to play the ball to both walls placed at the back of the opponent's half: if the ball is played to the opposing wall, it will serve as a support for finalizing, if the ball is played to the wall with the same jersey, the player who passes the ball will exit, taking their place, and the wall will enter the field, thus changing the direction of the attack in the game.

**Variations:**
It is possible to allow the attacking team to also play with a teammate (wearing the same jersey) positioned in their own half; in this case, there will be no change in the direction of attack, the player who passes the ball to the teammate will take their place. Limit the game to 3 touches.
