**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
October 12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Players are divided into three groups at the center (left wing, center, and right wing). A goalkeeper's pass goes to one of the players. If the pass goes to the left wing, the right wing anticipates the ball's arrival and runs to take the center of the field to play defense 1v2 (against the central and left wing). If the ball goes to the central player, the wing players wait for one of them to receive the ball from the central player while the other runs to the defense. Attackers should not wait for the defender to take the correct defensive position; instead, they should attack the opponent's goal as quickly and directly as possible. After the attack is completed, all players run to the center line, changing their starting positions.

**Variations:**
The goalkeeper first adds with his hand and then with his foot. Limit attack time.
