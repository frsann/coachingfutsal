# Drill 154

**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Development of the counterattack in a 3 vs 2 situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 15'

**Number of players:**
7 players: 2 goalkeepers, 5 outfield players (3 forwards and 2 defenders)

**Materials:**
Various balloons

**Progression:**
Player positioning: in one half of the field, there are 3 players, 2 defenders, and 1 goalkeeper; in the other half, the other goalkeeper defends the goal. The exercise develops in two phases: in the first phase, a 3 against 2 is executed in one half of the field; in the second phase, a 3 against 2 is executed across the entire field. The goalkeeper puts the ball back into play. For the three attackers to counterattack (second phase), they must, within their half of the field, complete 6 passes, playing with two touches, ensuring each touches the ball. Once this is achieved, they quickly attack the other goal in a 3 against 2 situation. After the transition is finished, it starts again.

**Variations:**
The game continues until the ball goes out of play, so if the goalkeeper saves or the defender intercepts the ball, a counter-counterattack is performed.
