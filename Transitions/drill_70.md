# Drill 70

**Short description:**
3+1+Pivot vs 4+1, the goalkeeper adds to the pivot or short

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, getting behind the player marking you, playing towards open space with quick transitions and defensive repositioning.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
3+1+Pivot vs 4+1

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
The attacking team is made up of 3 attackers + a pivot while the defensive team is made up of 4 defenders. Each team has one goalkeeper. The goalkeeper can pass a long ball to the pivot or a short pass to a teammate in their own half. If a short pass is made (i.e., the pivot does not receive a long pass), a 3 vs. 4 is established in the middle of the field. The 3 attackers can pass the ball directly to the pivot or switch it to the other side of the field with short passes, bypassing the defenders. When the ball crosses into the opponent's half, the finish must be quick, and all players can participate in it: attackers (3 + pivot) and 4 defenders. The attackers MUST use the pivot or get behind the defenders, but they are not allowed to carry the ball or dribble past the defenders.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches, limit attack time.
