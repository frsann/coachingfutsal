# Drill 2096

**Short description:**
4 players from the same team position themselves on the field (2 players at the center facing each other, and 2 players 10 meters from the goal also facing each other), and the ball is with one player at the center. The other team is on the central line with 2 players on each side, one holding the ball in their hands and one with the ball at their feet.

**Objectives:**
Practicing transitions and decision-making

**Area (mxm):**
40m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
15 min.

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
The player at the center with the ball makes a cross pass, and the player opposite him plays the ball to a third player, developing a transition to the fourth player who has become defensive. After a shot on goal, the coach signals for a player from the opposing team to pass the ball to the team that executed the transition, and the team on the side enters the field to play defense. When the attack with that ball is finished, the ball held by the player who was standing on the side is activated.

**Variations:**
Insert another ball and give it to a player from the team that starts the exercise. Allow players in possession of the ball to switch the attacking side once or multiple times. Limit the number of touches.
