**Materials:**


**Progression:**
When we have few players or only one goal, we can also train. In this case, it is a simple 3v2 situation with the goalkeeper (GK). We position ourselves as indicated in the image. The goalkeeper passes to the second defender and chooses one side to send the ball. From there, it's a 3v2 towards the attacking goal with the help of the goalkeeper and the defense closing in. The action is carried out until the ball is "dead."

* What we should pay attention to: Immediate activation, defensive and offensive order when attacking with superiority, quick finishes taking advantage of mismatches, etc.

* Variants or recommendations: Limiting/obligating certain passes in the finishing, setting touches to finish or play, counting goals, limiting time in attack situations, etc.

And as I always say: any variants you can think of and that help you achieve your training objective.
