# Drill 3601

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
All the dynamics of Futsal, in its expression and tactical component, are developed and trained in this type of activity, which can be proposed with the team divided into quartets, thus pre-determining which types of individuality, duality, and collectivity to review in these quartets.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, it starts with a 4vs0 drill, in which a strategic play for breaking pressure is practiced, starting from a 3-1 game system. It is precisely the pivot who will defend the 3vs1 in the following wave. Indeed, once the pressure exit is completed, the coach will give a ball to the 3 players who supported the pivot, to attack in 3vs1 on the other side. Subsequently, there will be 4 players from the other quartet positioned in all corners of the field. Those in the corners where the 3vs1 has just ended will have two balls: one will pass the ball to a player on the field who will shoot at the goal, causing a loss of game time and thus provoking a small transition moment; the other will quickly serve a teammate in the corner on the other side to launch a counterattack against the quartet in the field.

**Variations:**
One can hypothesize adding a 5 vs 4 action by deploying the goalkeeper in advanced mode from a throw-in.
