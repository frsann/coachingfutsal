**Progression:**
Let's divide the teams into groups of 4 depending on the number of players. Each team works separately. When the blue team finishes, the yellow team goes, followed by the green team. Simultaneously, Blue 2 starts by doing a slalom through cones, Blue 3 must touch the goalpost from the 6m line and then sprint back into defense, and Blue 4 performs a skip through ladders. Blue 5 waits on the 10m line in the attacking half. When 2 and 4 finish their actions, they enter the field, receive a pass from the goalkeeper, and go 2v1 against 5. Meanwhile, 3 tries to reach the defense. After the action is completed, the coach positioned next to the goalpost passes a new ball to the goalkeeper, who then passes it to 3 or 5. At this point, a defense-to-attack swap occurs, and 3 and 5 play 2v2 against 2 and 4. The attackers have 6 seconds to complete the action.

**Variations:**
Change SAQ exercises as needed. The player who last touched the ball must touch the post to play defense.
