# Drill 3254

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The activity proposed by Massimiliano Bellarte when he was at Real Rieti aims to train a defensive detail: the lateral closing, which can be adapted defensively as in this case.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Tactically, the players are arranged in two lines at the corners of the half field, and in front of each line, there's a cone marking the distance beyond which they can actively attack the goal. The goalkeeper sends the ball to one line, and the player receiving it must try to surpass the cone and shoot at the goal, or shoot and attempt to pass beyond the cone to close in on the other side. This is because on the other side, the first player of the line will already have the ball and will move forward as soon as the player from the other line has shot at the goal. From the same line as the player who received the ball from the goalkeeper, another player without the ball will start simultaneously on the opposite side, playing a 2vs1 against the player who received the ball from the goalkeeper and shot at the goal. The aim is for the player closing in on the side not to allow the player advancing to come towards the center or to find collaboration with the teammate in the 2vs1, thus encouraging, stimulating, or provoking them to finish towards the goal laterally, if a shot at the goal must be conceded.
