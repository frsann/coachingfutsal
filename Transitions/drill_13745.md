**Short description:**

Defense 4vs5 - transitions

**Progression:**
In 28x20, the scenario begins with an attack situation of 5vs4 with deep wings, and in defense, the position of the diamond point and wings. In the finishing zone, there will be 2 supports that participate in the finish only when they are connected from the 1st and 2nd line of attack: 1) two specialist trios alternating each action, 2) one attack trio in the 5vs4, 3) one trio for the attack of the last role change link, 4) the 2 jokers that will only participate in the finish of the plays in the 1st action. Jokers in the finishing zone can only play in one time, either a pass to the 2nd post or a direct shot at the goal. When the finish is generated, the wing that filters the pass to the finishing zone must touch the goal line or the post and then retreat. At the same time, they will play a 2nd ball for the defensive trio that will play a 3vs2 with the defensive retreat of the attacker who filtered the pass to the finishing zone. A 3vs3 with defensive retreat if there is a finish with a role change by the attackers; if the defense avoids the finish, there is no counterattack and the ball deactivates, allowing for the last link. In the last link, the assistant goalkeeper must launch a counter with a throw to the 2nd attacking trio entering to find an advantage over the defensive adjustment of the trio that finished in the 3vs2 with defensive retreat. If the defense manages to reorganize, the attack must seek to finish within the 3vs3, having the option to use both jokers as unloading options to seek shots in the finishing zone.
