**Progression:**
Let's start with a 3v1 on both halves, the game begins with passes from the goalkeepers. When the ball crosses the center of the field, a player from the defending team makes a run for a back press, changing the game to a 3v2 situation. When the game is over or the situation changes, the player who did not make the back press runs to the other side for a 3v2 attack. The balls should be positioned so that the goalkeeper can start the game quickly.

**Variations:**
Limit the attack time. Goals on one.
