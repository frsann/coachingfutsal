# Drill 3579

**Short description:**
Taken from YouTube Futsal Coach Russia, it starts with 4vs4 + 2 players at midfield ready to enter.

**Objectives:**
Transition phases, positional attack, numerical advantage, perception.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
You start from a 3vs3 pressing exit. BLUE ESCAPE THE PRESSURE, RED DEFEND. In the other half of the field, there is 1 defender and 1 attacker. If the defense recovers the ball (the one who recovers the ball takes it out and will position themselves as the JOLLY AT MIDFIELD for the next action), THE RED AT MIDFIELD will enter with the ball while the BLUE AT MIDFIELD WILL ENTER TO DEFEND. ONE RED WHO WAS DEFENDING IN THE OTHER HALF can accompany the action to form a 3vs2 in the other half of the field. If the BLUES manage to escape the pressing, then we keep the ball we were using.. the teammate at midfield enters along with one of those who were escaping the pressing, and one of the defenders can retreat to always form a 3vs2 (in this case, the RED at midfield does not enter). For the next action, it starts again with the REDS exiting 3vs3 and in the other half of the field.

**Variations:**
It is also possible to create a simple 2vs1 situation without having anyone retreat.
