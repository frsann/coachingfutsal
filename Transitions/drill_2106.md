# Drill 2106

**Short description:**
2X2 - 3X3 - 4X4 changes the player who loses the ball in such a way that they activate a teammate who is waiting next to the base on the opponent's goal side.

**Objectives:**
Defensive fundamentals and types of defense. Prompt and influence quick transitions to exploit the attacking surplus. Work on technical-tactical group fundamentals.

**Area (mxm):**
20m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
9-12 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, branded shirts, marker point

**Progression:**
Development of counterattacks. Technical and tactical foundations. Peripheral perception of the environment in situations of numerical disadvantage and numerical equality. We start with 2v2 on a basketball court, with three substitutes per team placed behind the goal-line. The game is constantly 2v2 and whoever loses the ball must be replaced by a teammate waiting to be activated. This way, we constantly play 2v1 with the second defender arriving to help on the retreat. We play two series of 2-3 minutes each. We do two more series of 2-3 minutes with two substitutions per team playing 3v2 + 1 player coming to help. Lastly, we do 2 series of 2-3 minutes in 4-4 with one substitution per team. Emphasize as quick a transition as possible. Decision making in opening a counterattack. Definitely avoid losing the ball during transition in numerical superiority.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the field, limit the number of touches, players can be substituted when they make a shot, not just when they lose the ball.
