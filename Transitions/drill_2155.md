**Progression:**
The game is 3 vs 3 on a 28 x 20 field with retreating and 3 touches allowed. Each team has 2 players at the corners on the side they are attacking. When the ball goes out or a corner is awarded, the player on that side executes a corner for the team in possession. We also execute a corner kick if there is a foul or a player exceeds 3 touches. If a goal is scored, the team retains possession and changes the direction of attack. Key focuses are: quick retreating and fast attacking from corners.
