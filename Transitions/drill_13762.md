# Drill 13762

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Beautiful activity that creates a lack of directional references in the game, but that focuses all its manipulations on objectives such as: numerous offensive actions and finishing, decision making for choosing the direction of attack, pressing on the ball to prevent it from reaching the wildcard which is the real trigger point for the finishing action.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
In a pedagogical context, a 4 vs 4 game is played across the full field with free touch, featuring a joker who remains fixed in the center circle. The action is divided into two phases and two objectives: the first is to connect with the joker, who must return the ball to the team members who passed it; the second phase of play involves choosing one of the two goals to attack after the joker's initiation. This type of activity encourages individual offensive/defensive actions to seek a directional advantage that must necessarily be established in the initial positioning of the other team members and as quickly as possible, to facilitate decision-making, even in the potential future, given the opportunity to choose either goal for completion.
