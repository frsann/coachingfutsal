# Drill 2088

**Short description:**
4v4, the third quartet is waiting outside to be activated by passing.

**Objectives:**
Work on defensive retreat, attacking transitions, counterattacks, finalizations, closing the far post, pressing on the ball, defensive balance, and withdrawals.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
3 teams with 4 players each, including goalkeepers. The game is played 4v4, either freely or with two touches. The attacking quartet, if in trouble, can pass the ball to one of the quartet waiting outside the field arranged according to the diagram. When this happens, the quartet receiving the ball enters the field and attempts to use the positional advantage to score while the quartet that passed them the ball takes their place. The entering team attacks the same goal that the quartet which passed them the ball was attacking.

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts. Allow an attack on both goals when the ball reaches the team waiting outside.

**Categories:**
