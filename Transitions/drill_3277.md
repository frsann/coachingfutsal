3 teams of 4 players - attack only one goal with 3vs3 - when the defense recovers the ball, they must pass it to the team that is out of the field and quickly exit the field - the attacking team loses the player who lost the ball and must give a high-five to the teammate who was out; when this is done, there is the 3rd defender who recovers - the entering team enters with 3 players and must act as quickly as possible to create a 3vs2.

**Variations:**
It's possible that it isn't the player who lost the ball that goes out, but a player selected by the coach.
