**Short description:**
The Futsal Way is an exercise that develops in waves connected with 3vs2 and then 3vs3.

**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**


**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**


**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Start with a pass to the center, and the player decides where to execute the superiority; once the side is chosen, it cannot be changed. Variant: An interesting variant is that at the start of the exercise, the player receiving at the center and initiating the superiority must do so by passing the ball, and the player who receives that second pass decides which goal to attack in superiority. Try starting the attack 3vs2 by dribbling and passing, and observe how it significantly alters the development of that 3vs2.
