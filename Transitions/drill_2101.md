**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
Exercise intensity: high Three attackers start from the goal line and three defenders start 10 m away. The coach activates the attack by passing the ball to one of the attackers. The defender corresponding to the position of the attacker with the ball stays to defend, while the other two defenders must touch the front goal line and run back to defend.

**Variations:**
Instead of the initial 1v3 defense, we can also play 2v3 so that the player who corresponds to the attacker to whom the coach passes the ball must touch the line.
