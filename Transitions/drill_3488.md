**Progression:**
Watch the video for the dynamics. The ball is given to 2 blue who goes 1vs1 with the goalkeeper or shoots at the goal. Immediately after, 2 goes to block the goalkeeper's release, thus creating a 2vs1 with the 2 reds against 3 blue, with 2 blue recovering (when the ball crosses halfway, they can fall back). Subsequently, 2 stops, 3 gets in line, and 4, who will do the same thing, starts. Every few turns, we will change the pair that performs the 2vs1 offensive plays.
