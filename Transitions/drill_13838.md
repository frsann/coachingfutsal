# Drill 13838

**Short description:**
3v1 on each half of the field. When the ball crosses the halfway line, a player from the defensive team moves over to turn the play into a 3v2.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we have the opportunity to quickly finish on goal. Increase the speed/accuracy of dribbling and passing while moving, especially in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We start 3v1 in each half of the field from the goalkeeper's pass. When the ball crosses midfield, a defensive team player joins to turn the action into 3v2. Once the action is finished, the player who didn't retreat follows the next attacking action on their goalkeeper's pass. Organize the balls so that the goalkeeper can quickly initiate actions.

**Variations:**
Limit time for the attack. A goal counts only from the first strike.
