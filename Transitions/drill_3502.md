# Drill 3502

**Short description:**
In this type of activity, which promotes training for numerical superiority, there is actually a static start from the attack and a very dynamic (in recovery) response from the defense. Situations are managed that also aim to improve the fundamentals of attacking, such as feinting, for example.

**Objectives:**
Superiority 3 vs 2

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
18

**Number of players:**
9 + 2

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, there is a goal in the center of the field, with 3 attackers on one half of the field and another 3 already ready in the opposite half. The two defenders, belonging to another trio, try not to concede a goal to the attacking trio: if they do not score, two players from this team will go to defend on the other side; if the two defenders concede a goal, one of the two will join the player waiting outside to go defend on the other side against the other trio.
