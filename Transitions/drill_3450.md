**Short description:**
The Futsal Way - EKA BESO

**Objectives:**
Ball possession in a specific area of the field, quick attack, and rapid transition in case of ball recovery by the defense.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P + 1 J

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, a 4vs4 + 1 joker is played in the central part of the field. The team in possession of the ball, once achieving 5 consecutive passes, can serve any of the 4 pivots and receive an assist from them to finish in goal. The pivot cannot score. The defending team, once they have regained the ball, can immediately pass the ball to one of the 4 pivots to complete a quick transition. The coach will always return the ball to the same team after the action is finished, for a set playing time. Transitioning from ball possession caused by the activity rules to a quick finishing phase and having to block a possible quick transition forces the attacking team to face all the issues of the various moments of the game. Conversely, the defending team will have different stances: from challenging the possession phase to defending the goal from a quick attack, but most importantly, they must always keep in mind the possibility of stealing the ball and being able to push a quick transition at any moment.
