# Drill 68

**Short description:**
2vs2 + 2vs2, players cannot switch sides of the field

**Objectives:**
Work on repositioning, pressure on the ball, quick attack finalization with numerical superiority, closing the far post, and counter-attack.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
2 teams of 4 players + goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, marked t-shirts

**Progression:**
4 red vs. 4 green on the entire field, so each defensive team can have only 2 players in each half of the field. Defensive players must play defense only in their half, and when they receive a goal, they become attackers and vice versa. For a goal on the opposite post, they receive 2 points, 2 points for a counterattack goal, and 1 point for a goal scored with numerical advantage. Attackers, in the attacking half, must score a goal within a specified time interval (6-10 seconds), and the difficulty of the exercise can be increased by reducing the number of allowed touches (max. 2, for example). Substitutions are made in pairs so that all players play on the first and second defensive lines. Substitute players enter the half opposite to the one they exited from. Goalkeepers start the action with a short pass.

**Variations:**
Reduce the number of touches, limit the duration of attacks.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
