# Drill 3665

**Short description:**
Work on defense/attack in situations of numerical inferiority - defensive retreats and defensive reorganization.

**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Initial positioning and initial development 3vs2

1st phase: The assistant plays the ball with their feet: Attacker 2 lets it pass, and attacker 4 decides with one control which goal to attack. If the defense recovers on the 1st ball or the action does not finish, the 2nd ball is automatically played (there is no counterattack in this 1st action).

2nd phase: The assistant plays the 2nd ball with their hands to the same trio that finished attacking to start a new counterattack toward the opposite goal (3vs3 with defensive retreat). If the defense recovers on the 2nd ball played: play continues until the ball goes out of play or results in a goal.

4 trios in sequence, each trio works in attack and then alternates in defense during the pause, and so on until the work block is completed.

Block duration: between 2/3 minutes.

If the defense retreats and reorganizes, it continues 3vs3 until the ball goes out, where the sequence is restarted with the other 2 outfield trios.

**Variations:**
If you want to condition the task to avoid 3vs3 continuity in the second ball, you can set the rule that there is no counterattack if the defense recovers (with this, we would focus more on the specific work of numerical superiority/inferiority situations - defensive retreats).
