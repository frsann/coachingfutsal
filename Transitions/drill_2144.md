40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls. Marked T-shirts.

**Progression:**
The game is played with two touches. In seven passes, the attackers must score a goal. With the seventh pass (shot at the goal), the attack ends. The defenders loudly count the passes. If they don't, the attackers can continue playing. If the attackers score a goal, the same defender continues to defend; if not, then the last attacker who touched the ball will play defense.

**Variations:**
Passing from the first touch. Vary the maximum number of passes. Play on both halves and have a competition with two teams.
