# Drill 3545

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Working with this type of asymmetry also allows for stepping away, at times, from what was the original objective of the activity, to work on other aspects of the Game, given that this type of work opens up many possible paths.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, we have two teams of 5 players each plus the goalkeeper, divided across half the field. The team in possession of the ball has 2 players in the defensive half and 3 players in the offensive half. The game starts with a 2vs3 pressure release. The two players must pass to one of the 3 teammates positioned on the halfway line: one in the center and two on the sides. If the ball is received by one of the 3, a 3vs2 will be played in the other half of the field. The game is continuous, respecting the positioning of the players on the field and the asymmetries. Work will be done on the automatisms of a first line of defense with an intermediate player. At the same time, work can be done on the timing and relationships of a basic 2-player combination to relieve pressure. You can also work on the leading and defense in a 3vs2.
