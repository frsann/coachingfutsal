# Drill 153

**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Development of the counterattack in a 2 versus 1 situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 15'

**Number of players:**
6 players: 2 goalkeepers, 4 outfield players (3 forwards and 1 defender)

**Materials:**
Various balloons

**Progression:**
Player positioning: On one half of the field, 3 players, 1 defender, and 1 goalkeeper are positioned; on the other half, the other goalkeeper defends the goal. The exercise develops in two phases: in the first phase, a 3 versus 1 is executed on one half of the field; in the second phase, a 2 versus 1 is executed on the whole field. The goalkeeper puts the ball back into play. For the three attackers to perform the 2 versus 1 (second phase), they must: within the half field, complete 6 passes, playing with one touch, and all three must touch the ball. The attacker who last touched the ball does not participate in the 2 versus 1. Once the transition is complete, it starts again.

**Variations:**
The game is played until the ball goes out of the field, so if the goalkeeper saves or the defender intercepts the ball, a counter-counterattack is made.
