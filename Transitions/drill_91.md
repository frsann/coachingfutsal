# Drill 91

**Short description:**
After the diagonal, it's a 2vs1 towards the other goal.

**Objectives:**
Diagonal, 2vs1 and 1vs2

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, portable goals.

**Progression:**
We are conducting an exercise on half the field in groups of three. Each group executes 2 actions and then we make a substitution. Player no. 4 passes to player no. 2 and seeks a diagonal. Player no. 2 receives the ball and passes it to player no. 4 over the head of player no. 3. Player no. 4 volleys the shot. As soon as the shot is completed, the goalkeeper (G) passes the ball to player no. 3 and then a 2vs1 begins. Player no. 2 plays defense, while no. 4 runs to create a player advantage in the attack.

**Variations:**
We are practicing on both sides so that players add and shoot with both feet. We are also working on a 28x20 field.
