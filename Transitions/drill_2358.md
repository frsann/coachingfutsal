# Drill 2358

**Short description:**
Continuation from 2v2 to 3v2 with limited time after the goalkeeper's throw-in. The player following the 3v2 action does not return.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we are in the position of quickly finalizing on goal. Increase speed/accuracy while driving and passing the ball as we move. Develop specific endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
from 8 to 12

**Number of players:**
8 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
We position the players as in the photo. 2v2 in each field + goalkeepers and possibly players behind the goal line who help the goalkeepers to make the action as fast and high-quality as possible. Only the attackers can play in the space between two dotted lines. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the attackers in the opponent's half. When the ball crosses the halfway line, another attacker from the defensive half joins the attack. The attackers have 5 seconds to complete the action. The player who joins a 3v2 action does not return to their half, but one of the other two attackers does, depending on their assessment. The goalkeeper starts a new action with a new ball, and we continue the sequence.

**Variations:**
Modify the number of touches. Change the time to complete the action. The coach determines which player returns to defense.
