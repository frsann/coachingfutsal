# Drill 2076

**Short description:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker, who receives it in the safety zone before attempting to finalize a 1v2.

**Objectives:**
Warming.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
Divide the playing area into two halves with a safety zone in the middle. In each half, we have a goalkeeper and two defenders against one attacker. The goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker, who receives it in the safety zone before attempting to finalize the 1v2. If the defenders win the ball, they can combine and move into the attacking half and attack 3v2 to score. If possession changes again, defenders can try to stop the attack through retreating. Each goal scored is worth one point.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: • One attacker can retreat to the safe zone. • A defender who wins the ball passes it to a teammate in the central zone who tries to score through 1v1 + goalkeeper. • Defenders can return to stop the attack. • The team that scores continues to play while a new team enters to play. PROGRESSION • The goalkeeper starts the attack by passing the ball to a teammate on the defensive half, who then tries to play forward to an attacker in the safe zone.
