# Drill 2879

**Short description:**
We start with 1v1 with a short goalkeeper pass, then over to 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, up to 4v4.

**Objectives:**
Work on counterattacks, quick transitions, finishing, goalkeeper passes, off-the-ball movements, closing the far post, pressing the ball, defensive balance, and pullbacks.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
2-3 sets per team in equal numbers and power play

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, branded t-shirts

**Progression:**
On the field, we start with 1v1 from a goalkeeper throw-in. Players, each team on one side, line up at the center outside the field and wait for their turn. As soon as the 1v1 finishes, the goalkeeper with another ball activates an attacker by passing the ball to him for 2v1. After that, the goalkeeper who defended activates a teammate for 2v2 and so on from 3v2, 3v3, 4v3 to 4v4.

**Variations:**
A goal to the far post is worth double. A player entering cannot finish before his teammate touches the ball.
