**Short description:**
2v1 counterattacks with recovery on a reduced field

**Objectives:**
Transitions, fallback

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
6 + 3P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
A goalkeeper (or assistant) positions themselves at the end of the field, and as soon as the goalkeeper on the field delivers the ball to one of the 2 attackers, one of the 2 defenders receives a ball and must shoot at the goal and then retreat as quickly as possible to help the teammate who, in the meantime, is defending a 2vs1. If the ball is recovered, attack the other goal until the action ends. Once the action is finished, the same 2 defenders will present themselves again in position to challenge another 2 attackers. Evaluate how many consecutive defensive situations the defenders can handle before the "role change" and consequent rest.
