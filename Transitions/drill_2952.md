# Drill 2952

**Short description:**
3v1 in each half of the field. When the ball crosses the midfield, a player from the defensive team moves over to turn the play into 3v2.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to quickly finish at the goal. Increase speed/accuracy while dribbling and passing the ball as we move, especially in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We start with a 3v1 in each half of the field from the goalkeeper's pass. When the ball crosses the midfield, the defensive team's player moves to turn the play into a 3v2. When the play is finished, the player who didn't pull back follows the next offensive play upon the goalkeeper's pass. Organize the balls so the goalkeeper can quickly initiate actions.

**Variations:**
Limit the time for attack. A goal only counts from the first attempt.
