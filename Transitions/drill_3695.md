**Area (mxm):**

**Number of players:**

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Rondo 4x2 + 2 Rules: 4 Teams. 2 Attack and 2 Defend. One defending pair inside the square and another outside who cannot remain still at any time. The game is played with 2 touches. When the attackers lose the ball, they must pressure it (only the pair that lost it, the other pair presses the opponents outside) to prevent the ball from being played out of the square in control. The ball must exit by a pass from the players inside, which needs to be controlled outside. If the pair that lost the ball recovers it, they continue attacking, and the defending pair switches positions with the ones outside. If the defending pair recovers the ball and manages to pass it to the pair outside, both pairs switch to attack, the pair that lost the ball switches to defend, and the other pair waits outside.
