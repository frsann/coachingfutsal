# Drill 158

**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Counterattack concepts in a 3 vs 2 situation. Delay and fallback. Save in a situation of inferiority, for the goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
At least 8 players: 2 goalkeepers, 3 strikers, and 2 defenders

**Materials:**
1 ball for every situation

**Progression:**
The exercise is a repeated three against two, in which two defenders are added first, followed by an attacker with the ball, as soon as the two defenders complete the defensive phase. The two defenders start inside the center circle, and one of them must touch one of the attackers before they cross the midfield in order to defend, otherwise, the exercise will continue as a three against one. After the transition, the last two attackers who touched the ball go to the center circle ready to defend, while the defenders and the third attacker go to rest.

**Variations:**
Insert technical limitations: for example, attackers must play with a limit of 3 touches.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
