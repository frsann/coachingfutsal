# Drill 2238

**Short description:**
Trying to make the most of open field situations and supernumerary situations, a lot of time is spent on mental transition to transform a good defensive action into a high percentage shot. Proposing this type of activity would favor the training of this mental transition, experiencing many moments of this type.Didactically the 2vs2 is carried out in a pitch of 40x20 for a time ranging from 40 seconds to 1 minute. The help of 1 joker favors numerical superiority, to be exploited and to have to defend. When the ball goes out, the goalkeeper should put the ball back into play quickly, or the coach can pass another ball.
