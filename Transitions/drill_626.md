# Drill 626

**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Counterattack concepts in a 3 versus 2 situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 2 to 4 sets of: 4' of action + 1' of recovery

**Number of players:**
7 players: 2 goalkeepers, 5 field players: 3 forwards positioned beyond midfield and 2 defenders on the other side at the level of the center circle.

**Materials:**
Various balloons

**Progression:**
A defender passes the ball to one of the forwards. This starts a 3 vs. 2 situation. If the defenders recover the ball, they attack the opposing goal in a 2 vs. 2 situation, and the last forward who touched the ball cannot defend. The play continues until the action ends: the ball goes out of bounds or into the net. After the transition is over, the last two forwards who touched the ball stay to defend, while the others rest.

**Variations:**
If the couple concedes a goal, they remain to defend for an additional round.
