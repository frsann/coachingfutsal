**Progression:**
Exercise intensity: high Three attackers start from the goal line and three defenders start from 10 m. The coach activates the attack by passing the ball to one of the attackers. The defender matching the position of the attacker with the ball stays to play defense, while the other two defenders need to touch the goal line in front and run back to play defense.

**Variations:**
Instead of the initial 1v3 defense, we can also play 2v3 where the player who corresponds to the attacker to whom the coach passes the ball must touch the line.
