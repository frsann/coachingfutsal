# Drill 3500

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
This activity by Ceppi places us in a situation of pressure exits, trying to find a pivot or at least an advanced reference, and immediately after changing attitudes on the field, because in front there is no longer a processing but, with a clear change in mental posture, an opportunity for finalization with numerical superiority.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, players are divided into groups of three that alternate on the field, as well as the starting goal and thus the direction of play. One group presses against another, trying to find an advanced reference positioned across half-field in a 5x20 meter space. When the ball is successfully passed to this player, the defending group will leave the field, while the outgoing group will attack in a 3vs2 situation against the player serving as the offensive point (who will return the ball to the passer) and another teammate from the group. Subsequently, the two who defended, along with the other player from the group, will press against the team that just finished attacking the 3vs2. During the 3vs3 exit, if the pressing team steals the ball, they try to finalize.
