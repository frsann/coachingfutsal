Work on defensive retreat, attacking transitions, counterattacks, finishing, covering the far post, pressing the ball, defensive balance, and withdrawals.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts

**Progression:**
2 teams of 5 players each. Each team consists of 3 players in the attacking half and two in the defensive half. Only three defensive players in the attacking half can intercept the goalkeeper's pass, but not the two in the defensive half. If one of the three players from the attacking half returns the ball to a teammate in the defensive half, they can join their teammates in the attacking half to create a 4v2 attack. The attack must be completed within 15 seconds. Each successful direct pass from the goalkeeper to a teammate in the attacking half is worth 1 point. Each goal at the far post is worth 2 points. A regular goal is worth one point. Each good save by the goalkeeper is worth 1 point. Every foul that prevents a goal is worth -1 point.

**Variations:**
Only a first-touch goal counts.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
