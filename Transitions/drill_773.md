**Short description:**
Set-piece situations – Free kick and transition into a play situation

**Objectives:**
Automation of set-play schemes: kick-off, throw-in, corners, free kicks. Game developments typical of the transformation situation.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20 meters

**Duration (min):**
From 8’ to 20’

**Number of players:**
At least 6 players: 4 outfield players and 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
Various balloons.

**Progression:**
It starts with the execution of a set-piece play (in this example, a throw-in). Once the set-piece is completed, a 3 vs. 1 situation begins. The attacker who last touches the ball goes to defend. The goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the other 3 attackers. Playing with one touch, they must finish the situation in the other goal.

**Variations:**
The exercise can also be performed in a 20x20 meter area, with 2 goals. It turns into a 2x2 situation: defenders finishing and an attacker. It turns into other situations: e.g. 3 against 2; 2x2 + 1 joker who plays behind the goal being attacked.
