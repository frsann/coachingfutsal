**Short description:**
Work to Improve High Defense and Superiorities Tactical Football

**Objectives:**
We work on the movements we have established in breaking the press and will try to improve the pressure on the other team based on our type of defense, whether it be man-to-man, zone, or switching.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**

**Progression:**
Two teams of four players compete on a 28x20 court (it can also be done on a 20x40 court) with the main objective of working on pressure and rapid finishing in superior positions. The exercise begins with a goal kick in a 3x3 setup while maintaining one attacker and one defender on the opposite field. The goalkeeper is required to make a short pass to force the team under pressure to construct plays to advance, and the pressing team to improve their pressure. We work on predetermined movements for escaping pressure and aim to improve the other team's pressure based on our type of defense, whether it be individual, zonal, or switch-based. The team breaking out must make contact with the pivot on the opposite field. Once contact is made, a player from the attacking team enters to create a 2x1 situation. We allow a maximum of six seconds to conclude this situation. There will be no throw-ins or corner kicks to maximize pressure-relief scenarios, so whenever the ball goes out, the goalkeeper in possession resumes play with the required players for a 3x3 setup. We will allocate a set time for the exercise's completion or a number of goals to change teams. The winner may be rewarded with staying on the field, or a sequence can be established with the three teams. If there arenâ€™t three teams of four players, we will allow the exiting team to keep one player to repeat the exercise with the new team.

**Variations:**
We can perform the exercise with the same premises, but instead of sending one player to the opposing side to make a 2x1, we can have two attackers and one more defender cross to make a 3x2. We will increase the completion time to eight seconds. We can also perform it on a 28x20 or a 20x40 field.
