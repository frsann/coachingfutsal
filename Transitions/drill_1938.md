# Drill 1938

**Short description:**
Corner + 2v2 in 6 seconds.

**Objectives:**
Perfecting actions from corners. Fast transition and finishing.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8-12' depending on needs

**Number of players:**
Minimum 4 + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We start the game with a corner. There is no defense. We work on pre-agreed corner actions. After the shot on goal, the passer and shooter become defenders, and the other two players become attackers. In the case of the image, 3 and 5 run into defense, while 2 and 4 attack. Attackers have 6 seconds to finish the action. Organize a ball passer to the goalkeeper to speed up the action.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the field. Change the time for the finale. The coach calls out the defenders.
