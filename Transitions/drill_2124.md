# Drill 2124

**Short description:**
Playing with an advantage while the opponent serves a penalty.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Playing with an advantage.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8'-10'

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Outside the field, arrange plastic circles whose number is one less than the number of players playing (e.g., 10 players, 9 circles, etc.). Two teams play a normal 6 vs 6 match (goals valid within 6 meters). Each time the ball goes out (no corners), all players must grab one of the plastic circles. Whoever is left without a circle must run several laps around the field (or do some push-ups, sit-ups) while the others quickly continue playing, so one team always has an extra player and tries to take advantage of it. The other team, which has one player less, needs to hold on until their teammate returns after serving the penalty.

**Variations:**
Change the number of players and the size of the field. Include goalkeepers but not to run in circles.
