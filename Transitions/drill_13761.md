Exercise proposed by Riccardo Grassi of The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Transitions, breaking out of pressure. Decision making.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Divide the group into two teams of 5 players with 2 goalkeepers on a 40x20 field. The game begins with a throw-in from both goalkeepers who must serve one of the two forwards. They need to try to pass the ball to the joker in the center circle, who can receive from both halves of the field. As soon as the joker receives the ball, they will enter the field with the received ball, attempting a quick attack and swapping with the one who passed the ball. If the defenders gain possession of the ball, to attack, they must serve the joker in the center circle. There are no throw-ins or corners; the play always restarts with a goalkeeper’s throw-in from the team that should have put the ball back in play.

**Variations:**

Positional Attack - Exit Pressing, Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
