# Drill 69

**Short description:**
4vs4, 4vs3, 4vs2, with each goal conceded, the team loses one player.

**Objectives:**
Finalization of an attack with numerical superiority in a confined space (basketball court with futsal width).

**Area (mxm):**
28 by 20

**Duration (min):**
12-15

**Number of players:**
3+1 vs 3+1 or 4+1 vs 4+1

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones.

**Progression:**
4 red vs. 4 green on the basketball court (with or without futsal width), free play, the team that scores plays 4 vs. 3, and if they score again, they play 4 vs. 2. After each 4 vs. 2 attack, we start again with 4 vs. 4. Each goal is worth 1 point, and 4 goals are worth 4 points. If the team playing with fewer players scores a goal, that goal is worth 2 POINTS (4 vs. 3) and 5 POINTS in case of 4 vs. 2 as a reward for scoring when outnumbered. When the team with fewer players scores a goal (e.g., in a 3v4 or 2v4 game), they get the aforementioned points and recover their player who was previously taken out of the game, while the team that had a full team loses a player, thus changing from 4v3 to 3v4, and from 4v2 to 3vs.4. Note: 4vs.4 is played with free touches, while 4vs.3 and 4vs.2 are played with two touches and one touch for the numerically superior team, whereas there is free play for the team with fewer players. (4vs.4 = free play, 4vs.3 2 touches/free play, 4vs.2 1 touch/free play)

**Variations:**
Limit the attack time.
