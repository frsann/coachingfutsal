3 vs 3 vs 3, on the entire field, but the defensive team players must mark two opposing players who do not have the color of their marker jerseys. For example, a defensive player with a yellow jersey can only defend (mark) attackers with green or red marker jerseys. Teams are made up of one, two, and three players, and each has marker jerseys of different colors. The team that scores a goal continues to attack, and if they don't score, they become the defensive team against the team waiting on the other side of the field. Each team has 3 marker jerseys of different colors. All marker jerseys of the same color are numbered from 1 to 3 (1, 2, and 3).

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches.
