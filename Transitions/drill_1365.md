**Progression:**
Educational unit: Defensive basics. Stage: After technification. Content: Space control, field of vision control and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We create 2v1 situations on half the field until 2 players make at least six passes between them. Once this is completed, space is freed for play and attack on either of the two goals. It is not allowed to change the direction of attack during the finalization. If the attackers cross the center once, there is no returning to the other side, and they must finish their attacking action there. The player who finishes the play defends the next attack. Demand from the player: Reading defensive orientation. Controlling space. Using basics such as timing and floating. Control of the field of vision, after correct basic positioning. Control of body gestures to avoid distorted peripheral vision.

**Variations:**
A goal from the first counts.
