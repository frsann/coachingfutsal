4v2+2 attack that turns into a 4v3+1 counterattack

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
At least 8 + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, marks

**Progression:**
4 attackers on the goal line and 4 defenders positioned 6 meters away from them. The goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers, who initiates the attack. At the moment the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers, a 4v2+2 attack begins. If the goalkeeper passes the ball to the one in the middle, the corresponding defenders must touch the goal line as quickly as possible and return to assist in defense. Or if the goalkeeper passes the ball to the side, these side players do the same. The attacker who last touches the ball on the opposite side goes to touch the goal line and participates in defending the 4v3 counter-attack.

**Variations:**
- changing defenders' distance from the line
- altering the size of the field
- setting a time limit for the offense
