# Drill 1333

**Short description:**
The game is initiated by a passer from one team, and we have the following scenarios: 1vGK, 1v1, 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, 4v4. Players can score on either of the two goals and can change direction whenever they wish.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to quickly finish on goal. Increase speed/accuracy when dribbling and passing the ball while moving, especially in the final third.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on the needs"

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
4v4 game on 20x20m with goalkeepers and one passer per team located on the opposite line from their teammates. (see graph) The game is initiated by the passer of one team, and we have situations: 1vGK, 1v1, 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, 4v4. Players can score on either of the two goals and can change direction whenever they want. Once the ball is in play, no one else can enter the field until the ball is out of play or a goal is scored. The passer can play the ball to any player on the field. After the 4v4 action ends, the first round is over, and we start a new round with the passer from the other team.

**Variations:**
Players can score a goal only when everyone touches the ball. Players can change direction only when the ball crosses half the field.
