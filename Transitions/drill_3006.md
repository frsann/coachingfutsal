# Drill 3006

**Short description:**
3 vs 3 transitions with handicap.

**Objectives:**
Transitions.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
All the players.

**Materials:**
Balloons, houses

**Progression:**
The 3 defenders (2, 3, and 4) position themselves on the midfield line with 1 ball. The 3 attackers (A, B, and C) position themselves on the cone line at the 10-meter mark. The defender with the ball (in this example, 3) passes the ball to one of the attackers (in this example, A). At the moment the ball is passed, a 3 versus 2 situation begins where the defender opposite the attacker who received the ball (in this example, 2) must first go to touch the penalty area line before defending, and then retreat to balance the defense.

**Variations:**
Introduce restrictions on ball touches; establish a number of passes within which a goal attempt must be made; conclude the transition within a set time frame.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
