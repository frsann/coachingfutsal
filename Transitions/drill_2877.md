**Progression:**
Didactically, two defenders start from the baseline corners, while the attacking player with the ball starts 6 meters away to reach the opposite goal, avoiding the defenders' recovery. On the opposite side, the player who was recovering will attack against the other player remaining in the other half of the field, in a one-on-one with the goalkeeper. Usually, this last player touches the post before returning to defense, to provide a temporary numerical advantage and facilitate the goalkeeper in passing the ball for a quick restart. The goal is to create situations that can occur in a match and therefore need to be resolved, both by scoring and retreating. In all cases, the field could be shortened in order to give less time for the temporary numerical advantage to exist, making everything more energy-demanding and executed more quickly.
