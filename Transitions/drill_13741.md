# Drill 13741

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
This type of rondo can set aside the primary objective of maintaining possession of the ball, sometimes with a limited number of touches, but it can start from these dynamics to enhance the training proposal for defense (with the aim of stealing the ball) and for transitions, both positive and negative.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, two 4vs2 rondos are played in both halves of the field and each goal is defended by a goalkeeper. The two defenders simply have the task of regaining possession of the ball, and if they do, they lead a 2vs1 towards the goal in that same half of the field against the attacker who lost possession of the ball. If the defenders only manage to disrupt the play without regaining possession, the goalkeeper will have a ball in hand, which they will pass to the defenders who will then perform the 2vs1 against the attacker who had their pass disrupted previously during the rondo.
