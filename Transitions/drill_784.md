**Area (mxm):**
40x20

Balls and pinnies

**Progression:**
A 4x4 game is played with 3 touches and goalkeepers. When the coach calls out a defender, they have to go to the end of the field and re-enter. From a 4x4 situation, we move to a numerical superiority situation (which can be anywhere).

**Variations:**
The defending player who goes to the back of the court has to wait to enter until the coach says their name again. If they score a goal, the player who has the numerical advantage scores DOUBLE.
