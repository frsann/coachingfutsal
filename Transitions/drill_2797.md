Balls, cones, markers.

**Progression:**
The game begins by adding a player with the ball to one to four players on the opposite side (see image). The passer must pass the ball on the court between the defenders standing in a line at a distance of about 5 meters. Defenders can intercept the ball and attack one of the goals. If the ball reaches the attackers, they can attack one of the goals. If the attackers score a goal, they continue with the attack; otherwise, they become the defense.

**Variations:**
Attackers can change the direction of the attack once. Attackers can change the direction of the attack multiple times. Attackers can only attack the goal in the half where the ball was received. After the attack, initiate a counterattack on the other side. Start the game with 3 attackers and one passer on 28x20m.
