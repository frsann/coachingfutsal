**Short description:**
1:12:00 PERFORMANCE LAB NITTI

**Objectives:**
Train the DEFENSIVE JUMP

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
9 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
In the first area (approximately 12 meters), 1 defender against 3 attackers who can only pass the ball horizontally or backwards. This way, they facilitate the leap of the player who must try in every way to prevent the attackers' advancement. In the second part of the field (approximately 28 meters), there will be a second line that will attempt to stop the advancement, and if unsuccessful, will handle a 2 vs 3 defense plus the goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
Remove the zones and play a normal 3vs3 while keeping the rule that only horizontal or backward passes are allowed within the first 10 meters. The 2nd line, however, actively participates from the beginning. The ball can be started with a throw-in, corner, or placed by the coach as he wishes.
