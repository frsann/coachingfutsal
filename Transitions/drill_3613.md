# Drill 3613

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Activities like these reveal aspects of the game that are directly connected to collaborations, interactions, and, more generally, the relationships between players on the field. Yes, because if the primary focus dictated by the 3vs3 on a reduced field is on primary and secondary collaborations, both offensive and defensive, stimulating a "break" with the intensification of the initial aspect of a transition, whether positive or negative, indeed connects the collaborative aspect with using these collaborations to either face or propel transitions.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educationally, in a 30x20 field, a 3vs3 game is played with no touch limits. Each team has a line of teammates on one side of the goal they are attacking. After each shot on goal, the player who took the shot does not participate in the defensive action but goes directly to the substitution, allowing the first in line of his teammates to enter the field and take his place.

**Variations:**
A possible variant might be to have the substitution with the player in line occur not only after a shot on goal but also after every simple loss of the ball, every simple change of possession, in order to further emphasize the aspect of transitions.
