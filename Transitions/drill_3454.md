**Short description:**
TASK FOR INDIVIDUAL DEFENSIVE AND OFFENSIVE FUNDAMENTALS WITH LINK ALTERNATING GAME PHASES

**Objectives:**
Attack: switching between attack and defense roles, moving and relieving pressure, working on individual offensive fundamentals with and without the ball. Defense: in ball recovery, working on numerical superiority mechanisms (occupying lanes, mechanics in 2vs1, 3vs1, 3vs2, 4vs3 situations) and working on individual defensive fundamentals, etc.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
At first, an 8vs4 possession game is played with a maximum of 2 individual touches. If there are recoveries, that ball is deactivated and the coach in the central area will place a second ball, which the team that recovered it must seek to launch a counterattack by choosing, with their control, the goal where they consider they have a numerical or positional advantage over the opponent. In this phase, there are free touches until the ball goes out, then the initial 8vs4 sequence will be restarted but alternating roles, with the possession starting with the team that previously defended it, and so on. Block duration: 3 minutes. Ask the players to:

- Develop space creation concepts (various off-the-ball movements) after a pass or in a third-man situation.
- Execute good oriented controls to facilitate the second action in continuity.
- Make good readings and decisions in numerical superiorities/inferiorities.
- Mechanize and work on the movements of the positional attack in the build-up area when restarting from the own goal.
