**Number of players:**

3 balls, vests to define the teams.

**Progression:**
It's a 3 vs 3 game, with 2 attackers each holding a ball. They attack one of the two goals (the central one or the opposite one). If the ball is put out in the defensive zone, the first ball attacks the central goal, the second one the goal at the end. If the ball is put out in the offensive zone, the first ball attacks the goal at the end of the field, the second one the central goal. If the defenders gain possession, the one holding the ball cannot defend; the closest goal is always attacked.
