# Drill 1804

**Short description:**
2v2 continues to 3v2 with a limited time finish after the goalkeeper's throw. The player who follows the 3x2 action does not return.

**Objectives:**
Improve decision-making when we find ourselves in situations to finish quickly on goal. Increase speed/accuracy when dribbling and passing the ball while moving, especially in the final third. Develop specific competitive endurance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
"8-12' depending on the needs"

**Number of players:**
Minimum 8 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
We position the players as shown in the image. 2v2 in each half + goalkeepers and potentially players behind the goal line who assist the goalkeepers to make the action as fast and as high-quality as possible. Only attackers can play in the space between the two dashed lines. The goalkeeper throws the ball to one of the attackers in the attacking half. When the ball crosses the center, another attacker from the defensive half joins the attack. The attackers have 5 seconds to complete the action. The player who joined the 3v2 action does not return to their half but one of the other two attackers does depending on their assessment. The goalkeeper starts a new action with a new ball, and we continue the sequence.

**Variations:**
Change the number of touches. Change the time to finish the action. The coach determines which player returns to defense.
