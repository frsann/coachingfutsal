# Drill 942

**Short description:**
Athletic Training

**Objectives:**
Development of explosive and quick strength, goalkeeper throw-in, and attack/defense in numerical imbalance.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
Players divided into 2 groups, 1 defender and 1 goalkeeper.

**Materials:**
Cones on two parallel lines but asymmetrically, at a distance of 5-6 m.

**Progression:**
Players A and B complete the circuit in the following way: at each cone, they perform 3 jumps in place (the coach indicates the mode each time), then to reach the next cone, they must perform a sprint at maximum intensity. After completing the course, they receive the ball from the goalkeeper and execute a 2 against 1 with defender 3. Once the situation is over, the last attacker to touch the ball remains to play the defender while the other two return to the end of the line with their teammates.
