# Drill 3510

**Short description:**
Proposal for a simple training task for offensive and defensive lateral work (individual actions).

**Objectives:**
Defensive posture, duels, numerical superiority, decision-making.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
All matches (in 20x20 m) start with a player bringing the ball to the center of the field and, after a pass, that player assumes the role of defender. Initially only in one direction and then with the attacker able to reverse and attack any goal. The execution of the exercise should focus more on individual defensive fundamentals: body orientation, support positioning, maintaining a safe distance from the attacker, or moving into the passing lane (among others). Progression of the training task: increasing the number of players involved to 4 (2x1+1), a group action is promoted with 2 against 1 on the side lane, with defensive recovery from the player furthest from the center of the action.

**Variations:**
00:00 1vs1 with one goal  
00:40 1vs1 on both goals  
01:25 once the ball is passed, the player on the other corner of the same side as the receiver becomes the 2nd attacker, while the one from the other corner becomes the defender who falls back  
01:50 like the last one, but both goals can be attacked
