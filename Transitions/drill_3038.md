**Progression:**
Starting with 3 players from midfield, you face an imaginary first defensive line symbolized by cones. You develop movements of choice, derived from your own game model, which involves elaboration with 3 players and 1 deep (pivot). It ranges from give & go, to give & follow, or even attacking the first line without moving the ball but cutting on the ball side. After elaborating, you will face two defenders who will obviously represent the remaining defensive lines once the first is surpassed. You will try to conduct the 3vs2 in the best way possible. Then you will find a way to achieve a rotation, perhaps allowing the last person to touch the ball to not defend the 2vs3 asymmetry and return to the line at midfield.
