**Progression:**
A match between two teams with 5 players each. In the beginning, the teams were arranged as follows: - The red team starts the match with one goalkeeper, one striker who shoots from 10m (or plays 1v1 against the opponent's goalkeeper), and three players positioned on the goal line. - The yellow team starts with defense: a goalkeeper and four players on the goal line (phase A). After the 10m shot, two players from the yellow team enter the field (the goalkeeper sends the ball to them) and then attack the other goal in a 2v1 situation where the defender is the one who previously shot from 10m (phase B). At the end of the 2v1 action, the red team attacks. In addition to their player, two more red players enter the field to attack in a 3v2 on the other side. In defense, two yellow players participate who in the previous fraction attacked 2v1 (phase C). The next attack is again by the yellow team in a 4v3 situation (phase D). In the final action, the red team attacks, starting a 4v4 attack (phase E).
