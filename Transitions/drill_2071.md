Two teams are playing 4 vs 4 and have support on both goal lines with 2 players each (3 colors).

**Objectives:**
Decision-making, ball possession, and collaboration with the pivot in the final phase.

**Area (mxm):**
40m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
15 min.

**Number of players:**
12 players + 2 G

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, marker point

**Progression:**
Two teams (blue and yellow) play 4 vs 4, while the third team (green) is positioned along the goal lines in a designated square. The team in possession with the ball plays 8 vs 4 until they lose the ball and thus become the defensive team. The team that concedes a goal exits to replace the jokers, and the team that scores starts again from the center. Returning to the goalkeeper follows futsal rules. The game includes throw-ins and corners.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches by jokers and players on the field, allow jokers to score a goal, the goal counts from the first attempt.
