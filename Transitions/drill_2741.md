# Drill 2741

**Short description:**
How to build a 3vs2 in continuity - THE FUTSAL WAY

**Objectives:**
Dani Rodriguez with this activity carried out with Jaen Futbol Sala 2020-21, shows us how simply changing an order in teaching alters the objectives worked on during this phase of training.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
In the progression of the activity, we have players divided into teams. In the first part, those defending in numerical inferiority will later have a teammate who will join them by passing the ball to the goalkeeper and receiving it, and will go on to attack two defenders who will have entered from the group of players in line. So the order is: defense + attack + rest. In the second part, the training starts by attacking with the ball, without passing through the goalkeeper, with two other teammates from the height of 7 meters. Whoever last touched the ball in attack will not return to defense, while the other two will. The order therefore is: attack + defense + rest. What is important to note is that by changing a small detail in the structure, the entire execution of the activity changes as well as the objectives intended to be achieved. If weight is given to the negative transition, the attack will certainly be influenced as well, already considering a defensive position to counter a subsequent counterattack. If those attacking do not have to worry about defending, they will naturally use every means and tool to try to finalize in the best way possible.
