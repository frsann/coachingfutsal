**Progression:**
The game starts with 3v3 on a 28x20m field. When the goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker, the pivot behind the goal line enters the game to create a 4v3 situation. After the play is completed, we start again from the goalkeeper on the opposite side using the same principle. The attacker who last touched the ball leaves the game. The goalkeeper is not allowed to play directly to the pivot.

**Variations:**
- limit the number of touches for an attack
- limit the time for an attack
- start the game with 1v1 or 2v2
- a player leaves the field based on agreement between players or as indicated by the coach
- the goalkeeper can play up to the pivot
