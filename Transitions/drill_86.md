# Drill 86

**Short description:**
Make a decision - 20x40

**Objectives:**
Make a decision (withdrawal - superiority)

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
6 minutes

**Number of players:**
10 Players + 2 Goalkeepers (2 players are positioned in the middle of the field with a ball at their feet - 1 player per team)

**Materials:**
2 goals, balls, pinnies

**Progression:**
A 4 x 4 is played with 3 touches on a 40 x 20 field, with two jokers. When a player says "BALL" at the moment of control, his teammate who was acting as a joker in the center of the field joins the game with the ball he had at his foot (pass); he cannot score a goal directly. The player who says "BALL" has to exit and go to the spot where the joker was. If a goal is scored in a goal, the team maintains possession and switches the direction of attack.

**Variations:**
Let the game be free of touches. The wildcard can score a goal directly.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
