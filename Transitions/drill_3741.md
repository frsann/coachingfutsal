**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed T-shirts

**Progression:**
Exercise intensity: high. Three attackers start from the goal-out line and three defenders from 10 meters. The coach activates the attack by passing the ball to one of the attackers. The defender corresponding to the position of the attacker with the ball stays to play defense while the other two defenders must touch the goal-out line in front and run back to play defense.

**Variations:**
Instead of the initial 1v3 defense, we can also play 2v3 so that the player matching the attacker to whom the coach passes the ball must touch the line.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
