**Progression:**
The attackers A1 and A2 position themselves at the intersection of the midfield line with the sidelines. Defender D1 is at the kickoff; D2 is in the defensive zone. The situation begins with the goalkeeper holding the ball and launching it to one of the two attackers. D2 can defend immediately, while D1 can only start when one of the attackers touches the ball. The situation does not end until the ball goes out of play, allowing for a counterattack. Once the situation ends, the other goalkeeper starts.
