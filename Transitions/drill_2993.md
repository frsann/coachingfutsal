**Progression:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the teammate who starts a 1v1 situation. Once the play ends, the other goalkeeper immediately puts the ball back in play in a 2v2 situation. When finished, it proceeds with a 3v3 to conclude with a 4v4. The same applies to numerical advantages. It starts with a 2v1 and ends with a 4v3. For numeric equality actions, conclude within a defined time: 12". Progressions: Parity 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4; Disparity 2v1, 3v2, 4v3. POINTS OF ATTENTION: The goalkeeper can immediately launch deep, so those attacking must worry about retreating and preventing the long pass.
