**Progression:**
The game starts with 3v3 on a 28x20m field. When the goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker, the pivot, who is positioned behind the goal line, enters the game to create a 4v3 situation. After the action is completed, we start again from the goalkeeper on the opposite side following the same principle. The attacker who last touched the ball exits the game. The goalkeeper is not allowed to play directly to the pivot.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches for attacking. Limit the time for attacking. Start the game with 1v1 or 2v2. A player goes out based on an agreement between the players or as called by the coach. The goalkeeper can play up to the pivot position.
