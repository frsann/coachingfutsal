# Drill 1666

**Short description:**
Collective Tactics

**Objectives:**
Basic concepts of 2 vs 2: defense: marking and covering; offense: two-man offensive plays.

**Area (mxm):**
Â¾ of the field (28x20).

**Duration (min):**
From 8 to 15 minutes

**Number of players:**
2 goalkeepers and at least 6 outfield players, divided into 2 teams.

**Materials:**
1 ball, cones, bib.

**Progression:**
The 2 attackers (in figure A and B) attack the goal defended by P2; defenders 2 and 3 try to hinder the opposing action. Once the action is finished (the ball must leave the playing field), players 5 and 4 attack the goal defended by P1 in a 2 versus 2 situation, with the former attackers A and B. Practically, continuous 2 versus 2 situations are generated.

**Variations:**
The couple that concedes a goal stays back to defend.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
