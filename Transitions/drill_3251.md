# Drill 3251

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
This activity to train asymmetries, both stressing them on the offensive and defensive sides, is part of the way to train collective play by deconstructing the dynamics of the game.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Tactically, it is played 5v5 with the players divided as follows: for the team in possession of the ball, 2 are in the defensive half and 3 in the offensive half. The team not in possession will have 3 players pressing and 2 players trying to contain the numerical disadvantage on the opposite side. Additionally, there will be a neutral zone where defenders and attackers cannot receive the ball or intercept it. If the ball passes to the attackers, a defender from the front line can return to reestablish numerical parity in defense and then return to their position once the ball is regained. Similarly, if the ball is intercepted by the front line, an attacker waiting for the pass can return to help in defense and then return to their position once possession is regained.
