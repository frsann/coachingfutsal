**Progression:**
The 4v4 game with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field where each half features a 4v2. The defensive team is organized with two players on each half, while the attackers can position themselves as they wish. Upon the completion of an attacking play, the defensive players become attackers and vice versa. A goal at the far post is worth two points, 2 points for a counterattack goal, and one point for a goal during an attacking advantage. Play with two touches. Teams switch in pairs so that each pair goes through both the defending and attacking phase on their side.

**Variations:**
Attackers, when they move into the attacking half, must finish the attack within a certain time frame (e.g., 6-10 seconds).

**Categories:**
10-12 years, Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
