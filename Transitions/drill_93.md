# Drill 93

**Short description:**
We are practicing pivot addition.

**Objectives:**
Attack with pivot in the middle and on the flank, Entering 1st and 2nd, creating passing lines by the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
4+1 vs 4+1 with substitutions

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Attackers cannot cross the center line of the field. Defensive players can also only prevent the ball from reaching the pivot by positioning themselves on the passing lines. Attackers make positional changes to open corridors for passing the ball to the pivot. The pivot must position themselves strategically and open passing lines. If the defensive players steal the ball, they perform a quick counterattack. The last defensive player plays a realistic defense on the pivot. When the ball reaches the pivot, the actual game begins (entry of the 1st and 2nd attackers). If we want, we can limit the passing time to the pivot (30 seconds). We can allow the defense to cross the center only if they execute a 2vs1 on the flank. After the action is completed, we switch players. Three consecutive attacks for each team.

**Variations:**
Limit the attack time. Limit the number of touches.
