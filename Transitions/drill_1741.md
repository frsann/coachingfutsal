**Progression:**
A 4v4 game with goalkeepers on a 40x20 field where 4v2 is played on each half. The defensive team is arranged with two players on each half, while attackers can position themselves freely. Once the attacking action is finished, defenders become attackers and vice versa. A goal on the far post is worth two points, two points for a goal in a counterattack, and one point for a goal in offensive superiority. Play is set to two touches. Teams change in pairs so that each pair goes through the phase of playing on their own half and attacking.

**Variations:**
Attackers, when they move into the attacking half, must complete the attack within a certain time (6-10 seconds, for example).
