**Area (mxm):**

**Duration (min):**
From 8’ to 15’

**Number of players:**
8 players: 2 goalkeepers, 2 forwards, 2 defenders, and 2 wildcards.

**Materials:**
3 balls, bibs to define the teams.

**Progression:**
A 2 vs. 2 game is played with 2 jokers outside the field. The jokers operate on the wings, outside the field, and play with one touch. The 2 attackers each have a ball in hand. The situation begins when the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers, who attack the other goal. Once the play is over, whether it's a shot or the ball is stolen, one of the 2 attackers puts a ball on the ground and attacks the opposite goal. After the action, the third ball is put down and the opponents' goal is attacked. Once the third action is completed, the positions of the pairs are switched. The pair that scores the most goals wins the challenge.

**Variations:**
Vary the number of players. Complete the action within a certain number of passes (e.g., 5).
