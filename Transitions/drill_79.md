**Short description:**
3 vs 2 Transition

**Objectives:**
Development of the transition in 3 versus 2. Exiting the pressing situation in 2 versus 2.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players: 2 goalkeepers and 8 outfield players, divided into 2 teams. In each half of the field, offensive and defensive zones, a 2 versus 2 is played.

**Materials:**
1 ball, vests to define the teams

**Progression:**
A regular futsal match is played with the following rules: the goalkeeper cannot throw the ball beyond the halfway line; a 2 against 2 is played on each half of the field; the attacking team, when able to pass the ball to a teammate beyond the halfway line, can bring an additional player into the offensive zone, thus forming a 3 against 2. When the attacking team loses possession of the ball, a player returns to the defensive zone, creating a 2 against 2 again. Note that only one player can cross the halfway line, either the one who passed the ball or the other.

**Variations:**
Only the player who has passed the ball or the one who has not passed it can cross the midfield. To play 3 against 2, you must cross the midfield while controlling the ball.
