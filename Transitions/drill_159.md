# Drill 159

**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Concepts of counterattack in 2 versus 1 situations. Stalling and retreating. Save in a situation of inferiority, for the goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
40 by 20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
2 attackers, 2 defenders, 1 goalkeeper

**Materials:**
1 ball for each group

**Progression:**
Two forwards are positioned at the height of each goalpost; the two defenders are positioned at the edge of the penalty area; the goalkeeper defends the opposite goal; the coach stands with the balls at the penalty spot. The coach passes the ball to one of the forwards, who then immediately attacks the opposite goal; the defender on the side where the ball was passed must touch the goalpost before being able to defend; the other defender defends in a 2 against 1 situation. A counterattack occurs in a 2 against 1 scenario with delayed defense. Once the transition is complete, the next group begins the exercise.

**Variations:**
You can do the same for the 3 versus 2 situation.

**Categories:**
Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
