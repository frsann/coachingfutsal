# Drill 3650

**Short description:**
Three versus two counterattack with pressing.

**Objectives:**
3vs2 and 2vs3

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
2 teams with 4 players +1 goalkeeper and substitutes

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Goalkeeper pass to break out of the 2-2 pressing. The pass can be to the other side of the field or to one's own side. If the goalkeeper passes to a player on their own half, a third player can be added to the attack as support on the flank or between the lines in the middle. When the ball crosses to the other side, a 3vs2 is realized, meaning one player is added to the other side. This can be one of the two yellow players who carries the ball across the center or any of the two yellow players if one of the red players (attacker from the other side of the field) participates in the maneuver on their own half. If the defensive players of the first line win the ball, they must pass it to the same goalkeeper and thus switch roles; they become attackers. When the ball crosses the halfway line and if won by the defensive players, it should be passed to their goalkeeper, thus turning into attackers. In this case, the third attacker, who becomes a defensive player upon losing the ball, must retreat to their half of the field as quickly as possible to prevent a situation of 1 yellow vs two attackers or even 1vs3 if the goalkeeper quickly transfers the ball to the other half to which a third attacker can be added. Goalkeepers have, as in actual play, 4 seconds to make the pass.

**Variations:**
In order to add an attacker from the other half of the field to their own side, the two yellow attackers must make at least one pass between them.
