# Drill 2102

**Short description:**
We start with 1v1 on short goalkeeper passing and then move to 2v1, 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v3, up to 4v4.

**Objectives:**
Work on counterattacks, quick transitions, finishing, goalkeeper passes, positioning, covering the far post, pressing the ball, defensive balance, and retreats.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
2-3 sets per team in equal numbers and numerical advantage

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
We start on the field with 1v1 from a goalkeeper throw-in. The players, each team on one side, are positioned at the center outside the field and wait for their turn. As soon as the 1v1 ends, the goalkeeper activates one attacker with another ball by passing it to them for 2v1. After that, the goalkeeper who was defending activates a teammate for 2v2, and so on from 3v2, 3v3, 4v3 to 4v4.

**Variations:**
A goal to the far post is worth double. A player coming in cannot finalize before his teammate touches the ball.
