The attacking team in the same area starts an attack towards the opposite end's goal upon hearing the name and attempts to score by utilizing the advantage. The two teammates of the named player begin to defend the opposite end's goal, and the named player backchecks after touching the coach positioned at the end. The 2 defenders are not allowed to press on the small field; instead, they must defend the empty field's goal.
