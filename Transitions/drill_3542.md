**Progression:**
6x4 Grid Every time the team in possession manages to deliver the ball to the members on the opposite half of the field, they can score a goal. When the attack loses possession, only the players on the back line + the two internal players can make a defensive transition. The external players cannot defend.

**Variations:**
You need to decide first whether to attack from the midfield where you receive the ball or "go back" to the other side. Likewise, you need to decide first whether the defense attacks the midfield where it recovered the ball or the other side.
