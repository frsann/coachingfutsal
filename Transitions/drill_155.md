# Drill 155

**Short description:**
Transition

**Objectives:**
Development of counterattack in situations of: 2 against 1, 3 against 2, 4 against 3.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
9 players: 2 goalkeepers, 7 outfield players divided into two teams.

**Materials:**
Training bibs to define the teams, various balls placed near the goals to be quickly passed to the goalkeeper.

**Progression:**
The drills are carried out with progressively unequal numerical situations: from 2 versus 1 to 4 versus 3. The execution is divided into three consecutive phases.

Phase 1 --> It starts with player 2 taking a free-kick shot at the goal. As soon as the ball reaches the goal, the coach positioned behind the goal passes the ball to the goalkeeper who launches forwards A and B deeply. Player 2, having just taken the free kick, retreats to defend in a 2 versus 1 situation.

Phase 2 --> As soon as the 2 versus 1 situation is over, the other coach gives the ball to the goalkeeper, who launches forwards 2, 3, and 4 deeply to attack the opposing goal defended by A and B in a 3 versus 2 situation.

Phase 3 --> As soon as the 3 versus 2 situation is over, the other coach gives the ball to the goalkeeper, who initiates a new situation of 4 (A, B, C, and D) versus 3 (2, 3, and 4). Once the action is completed, it starts again with the free-kick and a new 2 versus 1 situation.

**Variations:**
It is possible to execute situations of numerical parity, always structured in counterattack.
