**Progression:**
The attackers A1 and A2 position themselves at the intersection of the midfield line with the sidelines. Defender D1 is at the kick-off; D2 in the defensive zone. The situation starts with the ball in the goalkeeper's hands, who throws it to one of the two attackers. D2 can defend immediately, while D1 can only start when one of the attackers touches the ball. The situation does not end until the ball goes out of play, so a counterattack is possible. Once the situation is over, the other goalkeeper begins.

**Variations:**
Finalize with one touch.
