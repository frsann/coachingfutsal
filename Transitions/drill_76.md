# Drill 76

**Short description:**
3vs3 with the aim of passing the ball to one of the 2 pivots on the other side, then it transitions to 3vs2 or 3vs1.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, "gaining the back" of the player marking you, playing towards open space with quick transitions and defensive reshuffling.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
The attacking team is made up of 3 forwards + 2 pivots, while the defensive team is made up of 3 defensive players. Each team has one goalkeeper.

**Materials:**
Balls, printed shirts

**Progression:**
The goalkeeper must always pass a short ball to a teammate in his own half. This starts a 3vs3 game on that half of the field. Each of the three attackers must touch the ball at least once before passing it to the pivot. The player who passes the ball to the pivot moves into attack, and his defensive opponent follows him. A 3vs2 or 3vs1 situation arises if we play without a defensive player in their half (VARIATION). If the attackers don't score a goal, the roles switch â€” otherwise, the attackers continue attacking.

**Variations:**
When the ball is passed to one of the two pivots, all attackers attack, and all defensive players participate in defense. Therefore, the defensive players have the task of preventing the pass to the pivots, and the attackers must play between the lines and constantly "earn the back" of the defensive players.
