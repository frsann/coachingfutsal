**Progression:**
2 teams of 5 players each. Each team consists of 3 players in the offensive half and two in the defensive half. The game is played as 2v3 in each half with the aim to move into the offensive half as quickly as possible. Only the three defensive players in the offensive half can intercept a goalkeeper's pass, but not the two in the defensive half. - If one of the three players from the offensive half returns the ball to a teammate in the defensive half, they can join teammates in the offensive half, creating a 4v2 attack. The attack must be completed within 15 seconds. - To make it easier to break out of pressing, one of the attackers from the offensive half can join the two attackers in the defensive half, turning the 2v3 into a 3v3. - When the ball moves into the offensive half, one of the attackers from the defensive half can join teammates in the offensive half to create a 4v2. After completing the play, they return to their original position. Each successful direct pass from the goalkeeper to a teammate in the offensive half counts for 1 point. Each goal on the opposite post counts for 2 points. A regular goal counts for 1 point. Each good save by the goalkeeper counts for 1 point. Each foul that prevents scoring is worth -1 point.

**Variations:**
Only a goal scored from the first try counts.
