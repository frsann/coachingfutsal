# Drill 3293

**Short description:**
We are practicing pivot entry.

**Objectives:**
Attack with a pivot in the middle and on the flank, Entry of the 1st and 2nd, creating passing lines by the pivot.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
4+1 vs 4+1 with substitutions

**Materials:**
Balls

**Progression:**
Attackers cannot cross the center line of the field. Defensive players can only prevent the ball from reaching the pivot by positioning themselves along the passing lines. Attackers switch places to open corridors for passing the ball to the pivot. The pivot must position themselves to open passing lines. If defensive players steal the ball, they execute a quick counterattack. The last defensive player plays realistic defense on the pivot. When the ball reaches the pivot, the actual game begins (entry of the 1st and 2nd attacker). If desired, we can limit the passing time to the pivot (30 seconds). We may allow the defense to cross the center only in case of creating a 2vs1 on the flank. After the play is completed, we rotate players. Three consecutive attacks from each team.

**Variations:**
Limit the time of the attack. Limit the number of touches.

**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense
