**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
2 teams of 5 players each. Each team consists of 3 players in the attacking half and two in defense. It is played 2v3 in each half of the field, with the aim of transitioning to the attacking half as quickly as possible. Only three defensive players on the attacking half can intercept the goalkeeper's pass, but not the two on the defensive half. - If one of the three players in the attacking half passes the ball back to a teammate in the defensive half, the same player can join the teammates in the attacking half to attack 4v2. The attack should be completed within 15 seconds. - To facilitate breaking the press, one of the attackers from the attacking half can join the two attackers on the defensive half to turn 2v3 into 3v3. - When the ball moves to the attacking half, one of the attackers from the defensive half can join the teammates in the attacking half to create 4v2. After completion, they return to their part of the field. Each successful direct pass from the goalkeeper to a teammate in the attacking half is worth 1 point. Each goal at the far post is worth 2 points. A regular goal is worth one point. Each good save by the goalkeeper is worth 1 point. Each foul preventing a goal is worth -1 point.

**Variations:**
Only the first goal counts. It can be done statically without other teammates entering the other half of the field. Create a safe zone in the center that is 2 meters wide.
