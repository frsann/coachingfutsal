# Drill 2627

**Short description:**
Link The Futsal Way - David Ceppi

**Objectives:**
The exercise is designed with the intent to train transitions in both phases while trying to remain as close as possible to match conditions.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
12 + 2 P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The play starts with the goalkeeper's throw (you can also decide here the level of difficulty to assign to the goalkeeper, with 1 or 2 defenders on the throw) to then develop a 2vs1 towards the same direction; upon regaining the ball or after the finalization, a 3vs2 immediately starts towards the opposite goal. As soon as the 3 attackers are about to cross the midline, the goalkeeper initiates another 2vs1, thus creating a continuity that, with 4 groups of three outfield players and a recommended step of 4 to 6 minutes, will be a good resistant strength training. 4' for 3 sets, 2' rest between each set.
