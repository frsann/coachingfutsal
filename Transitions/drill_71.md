**Progression:**
The goalkeeper tries to pass the ball to the other side, while the defensive players should position themselves to prevent this. If the goalkeeper fails to pass the ball to the other side, they pass it to players on the nearer half. The attackers must pass the received ball to teammates on the other side and cannot use high balls after the goalkeeper's pass, but can do so after one dribble or after receiving a pass from a teammate. They can also lead the ball to the other side of the field to create a 4vs2 situation. When the red attackers get the ball, they have 12 seconds on the other side of the field to finish the attack. Two points for a goal on the far post, one point for a direct pass from the goalkeeper to the other side, one point for each goalkeeper save. The team that collects more points wins.

**Variations:**
Change the finalization time.
