# Drill 3322

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The activity proposed by our friend Scocchera can fit perfectly as it has been conceived, in the second part of warm-up or already in the first central part, where a work for elaboration and finalization according to one's game model is found, followed by resolving an asymmetry both in the offensive and defensive phases.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, it starts with a 4vs1, where the only defender is on the pivot, while there's a 3vs0 exercise in development with predetermined movements leading to a connection with the pivot and the support of two players, while a third remains in their own half. This last player is the one who must defend, along with the one who shoots at goal in the 4vs1, creating a 2vs3 asymmetry against the defender of the 4vs1 plus two teammates who enter the field as soon as the first action has ended.

**Variations:**


**Categories:**
Positional Attack, Transitions - Attack, Transitions - Defense, Warm up - Tactics
