**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Resolving a defensive asymmetry has always been something that brings effectiveness to the team, both in terms of score composition and the stability shown to the opponent. The way it is resolved also has its effects: whether you can defend in the minority, quickly restore parity through recovery, or if the opponents' superiority action is immediately stopped at its inception, preventing it from being developed or completed.

Additionally, another aspect a coach should train is the repetition of events, which can be very common in Futsal. This includes facing multiple situations of defensive asymmetry in close succession during the game, even consequentially, known as the "contra de la contra de la contra" in Spanish: the counterattack of the counterattack of the counterattack.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, the team is divided into groups of three, and one group in defense faces various 3 vs. 2 situations plus recovery (perhaps stopping at 3 by changing the recovering player might be considered). It is important that the group in defense moves up to resolve the asymmetry within the volleyball court square, with one player at a time from the three, who goes to touch the 3-meter volleyball line in the offensive half before returning to defend.
