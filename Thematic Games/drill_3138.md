**Progression:**
A 2 versus 2 game is played with 2 jokers on the sidelines, outside the field. The jokers operate on the wings, off the field, and play with one touch. Each of the 2 attackers has a ball in hand. The situation begins when the goalkeeper passes the ball to one of the attackers, who then attacks the other goal. Once the play is over, either through a shot or a stolen ball, one of the 2 attackers places a ball on the ground and attacks the opposite goal. Once that play is over, the third ball is placed down, and they attack the opposite goal again.

Finalize with one touch.
