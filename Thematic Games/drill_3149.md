**Objectives:**
Theme games.

**Area (mxm):**
40 by 20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
All the players (8+2)

**Materials:**
Balloons, houses.

**Progression:**
A 3x3 is played with 1 joker in the offensive zone. It begins as a 4x3, and the action must be completed within 6 seconds. Once the action is finished, the last person who touched the ball remains as the joker (thus does not defend), while the other 3 quickly fall back to defend. The goalkeeper quickly restarts play, recreating a 4x3 situation that must also be completed in 6 seconds. The joker cannot score a goal.

**Variations:**
Establish a number of steps to conclude (e.g., 6 steps). Even the wildcard can score the goal.
