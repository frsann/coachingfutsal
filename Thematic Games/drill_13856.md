**Objectives:**
Scoring a goal

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**

**Number of players:**

**Materials:**
Caps, goals, markers, balls

**Progression:**
We play possession 3vs3. After 6 accurate passes, the coach shouts out the color of the cap (which is next to one of the 3 goals). Then the players must attack that goal and try to score. If they succeed, they continue with possession; if they don't, they lose possession.

**Variations:**
- Increase the number of passes - Score the 4th goal - Introduce special rules for each goal being attacked, e.g., first-touch passes, the goal must be scored on the far post, etc.
