A normal 5-on-5 game is played, with a man-to-man defense requirement as long as the teams have an equal number of players. When the coach calls the name of a defender, they must immediately leave the field and run to touch their own baseline. After touching the baseline, they return to defend with the rest of the team.

**Variations:**
The defender goes to touch the opposing goal line, this generates a transition to a situation with more time.
