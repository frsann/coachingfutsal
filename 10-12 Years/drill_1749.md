**Progression:**
Organization - two teams play, with equal or unequal numbers. One team defends a restricted zone and attempts to score a goal. The other team defends the goal and tries to run or pass the ball into the restricted zone. A caught player in possession of the ball must also pass it to a teammate. Change players within teams after each game. Teams can apply a specific formation on the field. Scoring method - points are awarded for each entry of the ball or passing of the ball to a teammate in the restricted zone or by throwing the ball into the goal. Keep in mind: • After a goal is scored, a new attack starts from the goalkeeper - after entering/passing the ball into the restricted zone, a new attack starts from the restricted zone. • Players can pass the ball to a teammate by air, rolling, or bouncing from the ground (bounce). • Players attempt to regain possession of the ball by intercepting passes. • Game duration: 3 x 2 minutes.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the playing field. If a player is touched while in possession of the ball, it is passed to the opponents.
