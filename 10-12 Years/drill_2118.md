We arrange the players in a circle. Five in the circle and one in the center of the circle. The player in the center with the ball starts by passing to one of the players arranged in the circle and attacks them with the ball. The player receiving the ball uses a give-and-go with one of the two neighboring players to escape pressure. The ball received at the center is controlled, then passed to one of the players in the circle, and they are attacked. The sequence repeats.
