# Drill 2972

**Short description:**
Reduced play with two carriers on the sides for overlapping. The carriers enter the play only without the ball, overlapping with the ball carrier.

**Objectives:**
Mainly focus on the pair play routine (move without the ball - overlap) and attack against the defense (mid-range shot).

**Area (mxm):**
20m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
2 minutes (4 sets)

**Number of players:**
8 + 2 G

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
Organization: In 1/2 field, structure G + 2 + 2 carriers on the sides G + 2 + 2 carriers on the sides. Reduced game G + 2 vs 2 + G, where side carriers may only enter without the ball overlapping teammates in play. After overlapping, the ball carrier will have 2/3 touches to decide (pass or shoot) and will have to leave the field. If overlapping is done with a player who does not have ball possession in order to free themselves, the game remains normal because the exchange does not disrupt it.

**Variations:**
We can change several rules, for example: entering bases without the ball also as a blind block, limited number of touches, 3 vs 3, etc., depending on your creativity and what you intend to instill in your team's game. We can place one player on the corner line (next variation). Finally, place one player on the wing and on the corner line (last phase of the exercise).
