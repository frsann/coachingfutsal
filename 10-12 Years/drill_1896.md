**Short description:**
Individual technique

**Objectives:**
Passing in a game situation.   
Speed of passing.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
At least 6 players, divided into 2 groups.

**Materials:**
1 ball for the group in the center; 1 ball for each pair for the one on the outside. Bibs: to define the teams. Cones: to form the goal (from 3 to 5 meters) and the playing area.

**Progression:**
The central group plays a 3 versus 1. The attackers, with the restriction of 1 or 2 touches, score a point if they manage to complete a pass by getting the ball through the goal. The goal is defended by a defender, who, if intercepting the ball, switches roles with the last person who touched the ball. The group outside the field makes passes with the instep of the foot, passing the ball over the players engaged in the 3 versus 1. POINTS OF FOCUS: Encourage precision and speed of passing.
