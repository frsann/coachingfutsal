**Progression:**
Keep in mind: - Play alone or with teammates. - Start practicing with one bounce, then one touch of the ball (head, foot, thigh) and continue to build. - Use both your left and right foot/thigh. - Play alternately... left-right, left-right, etc. - Set a goal, improve your own score, improve your teammates' scores. - Challenge teammates - call a number between 1-5 and they must try to keep the ball juggling that many times before it hits the ground - after that, they challenge you.
