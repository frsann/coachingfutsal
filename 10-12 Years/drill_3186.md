**Short description:**
Transition overflow from one half to the other half.

**Objectives:**
Drilling counterattacks and execution of 3 vs 2

**Area (mxm):**
40m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
15 min.

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
In the center, we place 6-8 balls, and one ball is given to the attackers (3 blue) on one half of the field, who will develop a transition against 2 defensive players (2 yellow). On the other half, 2 attackers (2 yellow) wait on the flanks, along with a defender (1 blue). After the attack on one half, one yellow player and one blue player move to the other half of the field, forming a 3 vs 2, but now the yellow team is attacking, and the blue team is defending. The yellow player who transitions to the attack phase takes one ball from the central line. The exercise continues until all the balls placed are used.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches, time the attack, count the goals scored, it can be played 3 vs 2 as ball possession.
