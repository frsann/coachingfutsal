# Drill 2045

**Short description:**
Transition flowing from one half to the other half.

**Objectives:**
Practicing counterattacks and execution of 3 vs 2.

**Area (mxm):**
40m x 20m

**Duration (min):**
15 min.

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
In the center, we arrange 6-8 balls, and give one ball to the attackers (3 blue) on one half of the field, who will develop a transition against 2 defensive players (2 yellow). On the other half, 2 attackers (2 yellow) wait on the flanks along with a defender (1 blue). After an attack on one half, one yellow player and one blue player move to the other half of the field and form a 3 vs 2, but now the yellow team plays offense and the blue team plays defense. The yellow player transitioning to the offensive phase takes one ball from the central line. The exercise continues until all the positioned balls are used up.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches, attack time, count scored goals, it can be played as 3 vs 2 ball possession.
