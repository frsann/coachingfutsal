**Objectives:**
Warm-up.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
Keep in mind:- Teams of three players move and pass the ball around the playing area.- Players aim to recognize when to pass the ball to a teammate through a small gate.- If the gate is covered by a player of a different color, hold the ball or pass it to another open teammate.- Pass through the gate, dribble through the gate, receive a pass through the gate, and immediately return the ball to the passer through the same gate.- One team tries to block the gates, ensuring more gates are covered than the players blocking them.- Change the size of the gates to decrease/increase the task difficulty.- Rotate the players attempting to block the gates.

**Variations:**
Change the arrangement of goals around the play area.
