Four players are positioned on the field as follows: one goalkeeper, two forwards, and one defender. The forwards are positioned on the central line facing the goal. One of them with the ball positions himself exactly at the center, and the other on the side. The defender approaches the player with the ball, who tries to pass the ball to the teammate on the side and attempts to break free from marking by moving diagonally or in parallel, in order to go directly towards the goal after receiving the ball. As a backup option, a one-two pass with the teammate on the side can be used.
