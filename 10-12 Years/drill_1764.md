Balls, marked shirts, cones

**Progression:**
The playing area is divided into three sections where the central part can be a rectangle or a circle. Two teams are organized, where possible, with a numerical advantage in the defensive third and equality in the middle zone. The goalkeeper starts the action by passing the ball to a teammate in the defensive zone who develops the attack by attempting to pass the ball to a teammate in the central or attacking zone. A player from the middle zone can move around the entire field playing defense or attack when needed. At the moment the ball enters the attacking zone, the goalkeeper starts a new attack. Players attempt to maintain possession of the ball until the previous attack is over when they can play the ball forward. The defensive team can win the ball in any part of the field and attack the opponent's goal. Each goal scored is worth one point.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: â€¢ Change the starting point - switch the direction of attack and swap goals to allow players to use different elements of the game.
