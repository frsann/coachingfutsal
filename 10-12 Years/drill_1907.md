The game is played on half the field, with all players positioned at the corners of the field. The players are divided into two groups, which perform the exercise alternately. The player passes the ball along the line to the pivot, who returns it so that the player can shoot at the goal; then they swap positions. Immediately after, the player from the other group begins and performs the same movement, and so on.
