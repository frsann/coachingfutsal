**Progression:**
Seven attackers and five defenders are positioned in the central play area. Both goals are guarded by goalkeepers. After a certain number of passes within the central area, attackers can attempt to score on either goal. Defenders try to win the ball early and immediately attack either goal. Rotate players after each game. The attacking team earns 1 point after a certain number of passes and for each goal scored. The defending team earns one point for each possession win and also for each goal scored.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: PROGRESS The defense remains effective even after the attackers achieve the required number of passes and exit the central zone. Adjust the number of players per team (8v4 or 6v6) and vary the number of passes before exiting the central zone.
