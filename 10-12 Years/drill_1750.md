**Progression:**
Three teams consisting of an equal number of players are arranged in an area bounded by a square, polygon, or circle. In two of the three teams, each player has a ball and aims to keep it in their possession for a certain period of time. Players without a ball attempt to take it from opponents and keep it until time expires. Scoring system - points are earned if a player manages to keep the ball in possession the entire time (1 point) or if a player takes possession and holds it until time expires (1 point).

**Variations:**
• Change the playing area.
• Players can win the ball only from opponents. The team with more points wins.
• Players without the ball try to gain possession and take it outside the playing boundaries. If a player loses the ball, they can try to regain possession or help teammates who have the ball. At the end of the game, the team that has taken more balls outside the playing field wins (1 point per ball).
• Two teams play with several balls. Players of the same team can pass the ball to each other. The team starting without balls tries to gain as many as possible and keep them in possession. The team with more balls at the end of the game wins (1 point per ball).
