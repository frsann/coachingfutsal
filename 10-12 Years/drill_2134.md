# Drill 2134

**Short description:**
2v1 from the center through a diagonal, parallel, double pass.

**Objectives:**
Basics of technique and individual tactics. Opening and marking.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
8'-10'

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts, marker points

**Progression:**
Four players on the field are positioned as follows: one goalkeeper, two forwards, and one defender. The forwards are positioned on the central line facing the goal. One of them with the ball is placed exactly at the center, and the other to the side. The defender attacks the player with the ball, who then attempts to pass the ball to the teammate on the side and tries to free themselves from marking by moving diagonally or parallel, so that upon receiving the ball, they can go directly to the goal. As a backup option, a one-two pass with the teammate on the side can be used.

**Variations:**
Change the position of the winger and the roles of all players.
