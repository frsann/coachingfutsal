# Drill 2054

**Short description:**
Individual technique

**Objectives:**
Improvement of technical capabilities

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15 min

**Number of players:**
8 players + 1 J + 2 G

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
The 4 vs 4 + 1 J development exercise is that players in possession of the ball must make passes with three touches at height (if the ball drops, they lose possession at that position). The defense does not play actively, but they should use their body to obstruct shots on goal.

**Variations:**
Head the ball only, and if the goalkeeper does not use hands, the goal counts from a volley outside 6m, increase the number of touches, increase or decrease space, change the number of players or jokers.
