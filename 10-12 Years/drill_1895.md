**Number of players:**
9 players: divided into 3 teams, each distinguished by a color.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define the teams.

**Progression:**
A 6 vs 3 game is played on half the field, with the goal of maintaining ball possession. The game is played with a maximum limit of 2 touches on the ball; 2 teams of different colors attack and the team of the third color defends. The role changes occur when the defending team intercepts the ball or sends it out of the playing perimeter. The team of the color that last touched the ball defends. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Encourage quick passing, passing the ball immediately to the open teammate. Penalties can also be introduced: for example, after 15 consecutive passes, the team remains to defend for an additional turn.

**Variations:**
You can change the touch limitations: 1, alternatively 1 and 2 touches.
