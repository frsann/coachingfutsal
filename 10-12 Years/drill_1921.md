# Drill 1921

**Short description:**
Individual technique

**Objectives:**
Shot: in a game situation. Closing on the second post.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
From 8' to 20'

**Number of players:**
10 players: 6 outfield players, 2 wildcards, 2 goalkeepers.

**Materials:**
1 ball. Bibs: to define teams.

**Progression:**
A 3 versus 3 game is played, full court, with two jokers who play one-touch with the team in possession of the ball. The jokers cannot score goals. A goal in the penalty area is worth 3 points; outside the area, it's worth 1 point. Defenders cannot enter their own penalty area. Attackers can enter the opponent's penalty area, one at a time and for no more than 4 seconds. Shots on goal must be first-touch shots. There is no corner kick; the ball always goes to the defense. FOCUS POINTS: Seek the solution of the 2nd post, as defenders cannot defend in the penalty area.
