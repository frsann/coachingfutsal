# Drill 1760

**Short description:**
Players aim to combine and pass the ball to their teammate in one of the end zones, who then plays 1v1 and tries to score a goal. The player passing the ball joins the attacker in the end zone with the goal of scoring in a 2v1 situation.

**Objectives:**
Warm-up.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
October 12th

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked T-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the playing area into three sections, with an attacker and defender in each of the end zones while the remaining players are in the central zone. The ball starts in the central zone. Players aim to combine and pass the ball to their player in one of the end zones, who then plays 1v1 and tries to score a goal. The player who passes the ball joins the attacker in the end zone with the aim of scoring a goal in a 2v1 situation. Each scored goal is worth one point. The team that first reaches a certain number of points is the winner.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: • Add a goalkeeper to play in the central zone, using hands or feet. Players aim to pass the ball to an attacker in the opposite end zone. Progression: • One additional defender can be added to the end zone to create a 2v1 situation. An attacker from the central zone who passes the ball to an attacker in the end zone can enter that zone to create a 2v2 or 2v3 situation.
