**Progression:**
Keep in mind:- Teams of three players move and pass the ball around the playing area.- Players aim to recognize when to pass the ball to a teammate through a small goal.- If the goal is covered, protected, by a player of a different color, keep the ball or pass it to another free teammate.- Pass through the small goal, dribble through it, receive a pass through the small goal, and immediately return the ball to the passer through the same goal.- One team tries to block the goals, ensuring more goals than players blocking them.- Change the size of the goals to decrease/increase the difficulty of the task.- Change the players who are trying to block the goals.
