**Progression:**
In the center, we arrange 6-8 balls, and give one ball to the attackers (3 blue) on one half of the field, who will initiate a transition against 2 defensive players (2 yellow). On the other half, 2 attackers (2 yellow) wait on the wings and a defender (1 blue). After attacking on one half, one yellow player and one blue player move to the other half of the field, forming a 3 vs 2, but now the yellow play offense and the blue play defense. The yellow player who transitions to the attack phase takes a ball from the central line. The exercise continues until all arranged balls are used.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches, attack time, count the goals scored, it can be played 3 vs 2 as ball possession.
