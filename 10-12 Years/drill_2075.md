**Progression:**
Seven attackers and five defenders in the central zone of the playing area. Both goals are guarded by goalkeepers. After a certain number of passes within the central area, attackers can attack either goal. Defenders try to win the ball early and immediately attack either of the goals. Change players after each game. The attacking team earns 1 point after a certain number of passes, as well as after each goal scored. The defending team earns one point for every ball recovery and also after each goal scored.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: PROGRESS The defense remains effective even after the attackers achieve the required number of passes and exit the central zone. Change the number of players per team (8v4 or 6v6) and vary the number of passes before exiting the central zone.
