**Progression:**
The teams are arranged in the following way 1(Gk)-3-2-1 vs. 1(Gk)-2-3-2 or in similar ways. The space is divided into thirds. The game starts with the goalkeeper passing to an attacker in the nearest third. Players combine and aim to conquer the next third. When attacking, players can follow the pass to support in the next third. We encourage players to move through the thirds in various ways, using combinations. When defending, players cannot leave the third they are currently in. Scoring method - Scoring a goal (1 point) or successfully combining (1 point).

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: • Pass and follow the pass from one third to another • Pass and follow the pass - teammate combines with ‘Back and Through’ • Pass and follow the pass - combine with ‘Switch’ • When possession is lost, defenders should remain in the thirds and formations they are caught in at the time of losing the ball, while attackers are free to move without restrictions and combine.
