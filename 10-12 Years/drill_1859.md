# Drill 1859

**Short description:**
Individual technique

**Objectives:**
Dribbling: with protection.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
From 10' to 20'

**Number of players:**
At least 6 players: 30% hunters, 70% prey.

**Materials:**
A ball for each player. Cones: form a rectangle proportional in size to the number of players.

**Progression:**
All players dribble the ball within the rectangle; at the coach's signal, they must dribble the ball at maximum speed to the rectangle in front. In this example, the last two players to arrive become hunters. When the hunter hits the prey's ball with their own ball, the prey becomes the hunter. The prey cannot: 1) leave the playing field; 2) lift the ball. Once all prey are captured, the game restarts. POINTS OF ATTENTION: Players must always remain in motion.

**Variations:**
The exercise can be performed, even using both penalty areas.
