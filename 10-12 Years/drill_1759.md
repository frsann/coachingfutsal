Training related to the game. Eight attackers against four defenders. There is one goal at each end of the designated area. The attacking team is arranged in depth and width and tries to maintain possession of the ball. Players can pass the ball around or through the shape. The defending players try to gain possession by intercepting passes, then combine to quickly score a goal in both goals. Change players within teams after each game. Scoring method - Attackers pass between two defenders (1 point). Defenders intercept the ball and score a goal (1 point).

**Variations:**
Consider ... • If there is a possibility among the blue players to pass to the other side, try it. • Three passes through the red teams or three interceptions by the blue team mean victory in the game. • Change the players who are defending after each game. • Add goalkeepers to the goals.
