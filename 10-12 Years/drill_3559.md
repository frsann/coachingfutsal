**Short description:**
4v1 with a sprint at the signal

**Objectives:**
Warm-up. Motivation for exercise.

**Area (mxm):**
5x5

**Duration (min):**
10

**Number of players:**
Minimum 10

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Let's divide the players into 2 rounds of 5 as shown in the picture. Two rounds of 4v1 with 1 touch are played in a 5x5m space. The player who makes a mistake becomes the defender in the round on the other side. The defender becomes the attacker on the same side.

**Variations:**
15 consecutive passes = 5 push-ups. On the coach's signal, all players must run to the central circle and hug each other according to the principle of 2 colors + 1 color (e.g., 2 green + 1 yellow). The player left alone does 10 push-ups as a penalty.
