**Progression:**
We divide the players into two teams. The game is played according to the following rules: - no throw-ins or corners - the attack always starts from the goalkeeper - the player in the center circle cannot leave it - the defender cannot play on their own half - you can move forward only by dribbling or through a one-two pass - the field is divided along the central line. After the action: - the attacker goes to the center - the player from the center goes to play defense - the defensive player goes to the end of the line and waits.WE COUNT GOALS.

**Variations:**
If an attacker chooses 1v1, they finish the action alone. If an attacker chooses a double pass, their defender can join in. The player in the center changes every three actions.
