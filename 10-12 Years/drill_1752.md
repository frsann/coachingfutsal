**Area (mxm):**
20x20

10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, printed t-shirts

**Progression:**
Players on the perimeter of the circle pass the ball between them within the circle or across the circle to maintain possession. Two defenders attempt to gain possession by intercepting passes. Swap players among teams after each game. Scoring method - each pass between the two defenders earns 1 point. Each interception by the defenders earns them 1 point.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: • The ball cannot be intercepted by sliding. • Three passes between two defenders or three intercepts of passes automatically mean victory in that game. PROGRESSION: • Two defensive players are added outside the circle. When a defensive player inside the circle intercepts a pass, they can pass the ball to teammates outside the circle.
