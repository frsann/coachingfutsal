**Progression:**
The teams are organized in the following way: 1(Gk)-3-2-1 vs 1(Gk)-2-3-2 or in similar formations. The field is divided into thirds. The game starts with a goalkeeper passing to an attacker in the closest third. Players combine plays and try to advance to the next third. When attacking, players can follow the pass as support in the next third. We encourage players to move through the thirds in various ways and combinations. When defending, players cannot leave the third they are in. Scoring system - Scoring a goal (1 point) or successful combination (1 point).

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: • Pass and follow the pass from one third to another • Pass and follow the pass - teammate combines with ‘Back and Through’ • Pass and follow the pass - combine with ‘Switch’ • When possession is lost, defenders should stay in the thirds and positions caught at the moment of loss, while attackers are free to move without restriction while combining.
