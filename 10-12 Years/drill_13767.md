**Progression:**
Training related to the game. Eight attackers against four defenders. At each end of the designated area, there is a goal. The attacking team positions itself in depth and width, attempting to maintain possession of the ball. Players can pass the ball around or through the formation. Defending players try to win the ball by intercepting passes, then combine to quickly score a goal at either end. Rotate players within teams after each game. Scoring method - Attackers pass between two defenders (1 point). Defenders intercept the ball and score a goal (1 point).

**Variations:**
Consider ...• If there is an opportunity for passing between the blue players to the other side, try it.• Three passes through the red teams or three interceptions by the blue team mean victory in the game.• Change the players defending after each game.• Add goalkeepers to the goals.
