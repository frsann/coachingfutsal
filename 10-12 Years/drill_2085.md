**Progression:**
Organization - Two teams play with either equal or unequal numbers. One team defends the forbidden zone and tries to score a goal. The other team defends the goal and attempts to enter the forbidden zone by running or passing the ball. A caught player in possession of the ball must pass it to a teammate. Swap players within teams after each game. Teams may apply a specific arrangement on the field. 

Scoring method - Points are awarded for each ball entry or ball pass to a teammate in the forbidden zone, or by putting the ball into the goal. 

Keep in mind:
• Once a goal is scored, a new attack starts from the goalkeeper - after entering/passing the ball into the forbidden zone, a new attack starts from the forbidden zone. 
• Players can pass the ball to a teammate through the air, rolling, or bouncing off the floor. 
• Players try to regain ball possession by intercepting passes. 
• Game duration: 3 x 2 minutes.

**Variations:**
Change the size of the playground. If a player is touched while in possession of the ball, it passes to the opponents.
