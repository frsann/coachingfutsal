**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked jerseys, cones

**Progression:**
Mark a rectangular area with goals positioned behind one end of the rectangle. Players dribble the ball through the rectangle and attack one of the goals upon exiting it. On the longer sides of the rectangle, players are positioned to pass the ball to each other through the rectangle. Players move in waves through the rectangular area, changing speed and direction while maneuvering with the ball. Players on the outside try to pass the ball to each other. Scoring method - Create a sequence of your moves. Improve previous attempts, copy someone else, or challenge your teammate to do something different.

**Variations:**
Consideration: PROGRESS 
• A "blocker" player with the ball is added inside the rectangular area. He disrupts the players in dribbling. 
• A defensive player is added inside the area who tries to win the ball from the dribbler. 
• For each goal, we add one defending player. They aim to protect the goal and take possession of the ball from the attackers. 
• Points are scored when the attackers score a goal (1 point) or when the defenders take possession of the ball and move it across the center line (1 point).
