**Short description:**
We always train defense and attack, field size and playing time based on the goal, preferably on a reduced field to ensure intensity.

**Objectives:**
Improve individual defensive and offensive actions in 1v1 situations.  
Enhance offensive and defensive cooperation between two players.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers

**Progression:**
Let's divide the players into groups of 2. The game is played 2v2 on a 28x20 field with goalkeepers in a tournament system. Matches are played for 1 minute. There are no throw-ins or corners. The ball always starts from the goalkeeper in possession. To better manage results, we can use one of the applications for organizing tournaments. Players who are waiting help the goalkeepers with faster ball distribution and minimize pauses. Reward the tournament winners and the top scorer.

**Variations:**
Change the duration of mini-matches. Change the size of the playing field depending on the goals.

**Categories:**
