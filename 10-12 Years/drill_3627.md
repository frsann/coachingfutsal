**Short description:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the forward who receives it in the safety zone before attempting to finalize the 1v2.

**Objectives:**
Warming.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, branded T-shirts, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the playing area into two halves with a safety zone in the middle. In each half, we have a goalkeeper and two defenders against one attacker. The goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker who receives it in the safety zone before attempting to finalize a 1v2. If the defenders win the ball, they can combine and move into the attacking half to create a 3v2 situation to score. If possession changes back, the defenders can retreat and try to stop the attack. Each goal scored is worth one point.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind:
• An attacker can retreat to the safe zone.
• A defender who wins the ball passes it to a teammate in the central zone who attempts to score in a 1v1 + goalkeeper scenario.
• Defenders can return to stop the attack.
• The team that scores continues to play while a new team enters to play.

PROGRESSION
• The goalkeeper starts the attack by passing the ball to a teammate in the defensive half who then attempts to play forward to the attacker in the safe zone.
