# Drill 1766

**Short description:**
The goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker who receives it in the safety zone before attempting to finalize 1v2.

**Objectives:**
Warming.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, marked jerseys, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the playing area into two halves with a safety zone in the middle. In each half, we have a goalkeeper and two defensive players against one attacker. The goalkeeper passes the ball to the attacker, who receives it in the safety zone before attempting to finish 1v2. If the defensive players win the ball, they can combine and move to the attacking half and attack 3v2 to score. If possession changes again, the defensive players can retreat to try to stop the attack. Each goal scored is worth one point.

**Variations:**
Keep in mind: • An attacker can retreat into the safety zone. • A defender who gains possession of the ball passes it to a teammate in the central zone who tries to score through 1v1 + goalkeeper. • Defenders can return to stop the attack. • The team that scores continues to play while a new team enters to play. PROGRESS • The goalkeeper starts the attack by passing the ball to a teammate in the defensive half, who then tries to play it forward to the attacker in the safety zone.
