The action involves one goalkeeper, one defender, and three attackers (one central and two wing players, positioned opposite the goal they are attacking). The goalkeeper puts the ball into play towards the central attacker who needs to overcome the defender (who is pressing the player with the ball) with a double pass with one of the two wing players before shooting at the goal.

**Variations:**
The ball from the goalkeeper can also go to the wing player.
