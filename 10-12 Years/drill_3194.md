**Short description:**
Like a little bull, the players in a circle are the defenders and they pass the ball first-time, whoever touches the ball must sit on the ground without touching the ball again; the defenders' goal is to end up all sitting, while the attacker's goal is to prevent them from doing so.

**Objectives:**

**Progression:**
The game is played with all players against one in the central circle with one touch. When an attacker touches the ball, they are required to sit on the ground. The goal of the attackers is for everyone to touch the ball, while the defender's goal is to take it before all the attackers touch it. If all attackers touch the ball, the defender remains in their position once more and must do push-ups or some other penalty.
