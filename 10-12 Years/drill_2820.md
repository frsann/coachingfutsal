# Drill 2820

**Short description:**
2 wheels 4in1 at 1 touch.

**Objectives:**
Warm-up. Motivation for training.

**Area (mxm):**
5x5

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
At least 10

**Materials:**
Balls, markers, cones

**Progression:**
Let's divide the players into 2 groups of 5 as shown in the picture. There are 2 rounds of 4v1 games on 1 touch in a 5x5m space. The player who makes a mistake becomes the defender in the group on the other side. The defender becomes an attacker on the same side.

**Variations:**
15 consecutive passes = 5 push-ups. At the coach's signal, all players must run to the center circle and hug each other based on the principle of 2 colors + 1 color (e.g., 2 green + 1 yellow). The player left alone does 10 push-ups as a penalty.
