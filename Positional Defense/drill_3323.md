# Drill 3323

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
The objective is to work on the first line of defense, having the players press the ball by occupying the central space of the field or the diagonal one when closer to the goal.

**Area (mxm):**
25x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
2vs2 game + 4 jokers. The 4 jokers are supports, 2 on the sides and 2 at the end of the field. The side supports enter the field every time they receive the ball and a player who is inside must change. The supports at the end of the field have different rules: the one on the same side as the ball can only make 2 touches and can only pass the ball to score a goal; the one on the opposite side of the ball can score if they receive a pass. The supports at the end of the field, on the same side as the ball, serve to make the defense work on the vertical one-two. So, we have an activity that works on different aspects: from 1vs1 defense, to frontline change, to closing central passing lines, to defending vertical one-twos.

**Variations:**
If we are short on players we can have only one side boundary or play without side boundaries.
