# Drill 2359

**Short description:**
Fonte: video webinar Juanlu 40:16 a 45:00

**Objectives:**
Stimulate the defensive leap.

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
3 vs 3 + goalkeepers. There are 2 outside players placed at the first 6/8 meters and if a player makes a pass to the outside, that player enters the field. But if the outside player passes the ball back to the one who played it to them, this player stays in and the outside player remains out. This is to ensure that when the defender makes the defensive jump, they will have to close the return horizontal pass. If the ball is instead played to one of the other two, then the one who passed the ball leaves the field.

**Variations:**
Same exercise but we divide the field in half vertically (imaginary line).. we raise the wingers up to 10 meters.. I can play the ball only on the outside of the side where I am.. if I am in the left half.. I play it only to the left, etc.. in this way we train "short" passes.
