**Progression:**
You start with a 2vs2 on one half of the pitch, the other 2 players cannot enter. If the defenders steal the ball, they can finish. If the attackers cross the halfway line, it becomes a 3vs2 attack (only 1 defender from the first line can return). When the ball goes out, it always starts from the goalkeeper.

The defender who is bypassed must touch the hand of a teammate and then can fall back.
