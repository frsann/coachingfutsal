# Drill 2380

**Short description:**
Musti for training defense of exchanges

**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
4vs4 + 2 external players positioned 10 meters away; when a player with the ball exits the field sideways, another with the ball enters from the opposite side, and the defense must readjust, with the opposite winger needing to move up to the ball, and the entire defense must readjust (change defenders every 4 minutes); encourage the incoming player not to necessarily look for a quick finish, but simply to draw the defense in to then attempt a switch of sides.

**Variations:**
- The exact same exercise but have the player enter from the same side, in this case, we will train the coverage of the strong side.
