# Drill 2105

**Short description:**
4v3 Work on substitution markings

**Objectives:**
Improving defensive fundamentals starting from situations of being outnumbered, aiming to isolate one attacker by closing passing lanes to them while pressing the player with the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + gks

**Materials:**
Balls, printed shirts

**Progression:**
Defensive fundamentals Control of space, retreating, timing, control of the visual field and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a real game on 40x20, always playing defense with a deficit of 3v4. The defensive team, although outnumbered, must press to prevent the game from progressing toward our goal. Attackers cannot cross to the offensive half before making at least 2 passes. (If we want, we can prohibit crossing to the offensive side with high passes) After the attackers cross to the offensive side, the defenders can play defense through pressing or play special defense 3v4. When there is a change of roles, one player from the team that loses possession must leave and, from their part of the field, one player from the team that gained possession of the ball enters. Ask players for: Pressure on the ball. Attacking the passing line. Reading defensive orientation and defensive orientation in pressing. Control of space.

**Variations:**
A goal from the first is worth it. Limit the number of touches.
