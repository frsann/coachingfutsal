# Drill 2958

**Short description:**
4v3 Work on marking substitutions

**Objectives:**
Improving defensive foundations starting from situations of being outnumbered, aiming to isolate an attacker by closing passing lanes towards them while pressuring the player with the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + hugs

**Materials:**
Balls, marked shirts

**Progression:**
Educational unit: Defensive Fundamentals. Stage: After technification. Content: Space control, floating, retreat, delay (timing), field of vision control and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a realistic game on 40x20, always playing defense with a 3v4 disadvantage. The defensive team, although at a disadvantage, must press to prevent advances towards our goal. Attackers cannot cross to the attacking half before making at least 2 passes. (If desired, we can prohibit crossing to the attacking side with high passes.) After the attackers cross to the attacking side, defenders can play defense through pressing or play special defense 3v4. When there is a change of roles, one player from the team that loses possession must exit, and one player from the team that gains possession enters from their side of the field. Require players to: Pressure the ball, read defensive orientation and defensive pressing orientation, control space, employ fundamentals such as delay and floating, and spatial mastery of game progression settings.

**Variations:**
A goal from the first counts.
