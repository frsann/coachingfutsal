**Short description:**
Seated, color and parade.

**Objectives:**
Strength, technique, against time and psycho-kinetics.

**Area (mxm):**
Goal area.

**Duration (min):**
6/8 repetitions

**Number of players:**
Goalkeeper + Coach

**Materials:**
Balls, 2 cones (1 blue + 1 red), two colored stoppers (1 blue + 1 red).

**Progression:**
Place two cones of different colors near the goalposts. The goalkeeper starts seated in the center of the goal (on the line) while the coach positions themselves at the edge of the area with the balls. The coach hides behind their back two bibs of the same color as the cones placed near the posts. At the signal, the coach shows a bib to the goalkeeper, who then goes to touch the cone of the corresponding color. Following this, the goalkeeper will dive to save the low shot from the coach to the opposite post.

**Variations:**
Add a third colored frattino, without a cone. Green color = 1:1 session with the coach.
