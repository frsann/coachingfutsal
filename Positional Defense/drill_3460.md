# Drill 3460

**Short description:**
Post-warm-up, possession at midfield.

**Objectives:**
Ball possession, defensive triangle, transitions

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10

**Number of players:**
12

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Possession exercise with only 3 defenders against 3 teams arranged in groups of 3. If the defense intercepts, they must try to score in one of the 4 small goals located at the corners of the half field. I can only pass the ball to a color different from my own. If the ball is kicked out by the teams maintaining possession, the coach hands the ball to the defending trio (because it means the ball was recovered anyway). Change the trio every 60/90 seconds (see video PERFORMANCE LAB 1:02:50).

**Variations:**
Make 3 teams of 4, add the goalkeepers and play on a 28x20 field. 2 teams focus on possession while 1 tries to recover the ball. Switch every 2 minutes and set up 4 goals with 4 goalkeepers.
