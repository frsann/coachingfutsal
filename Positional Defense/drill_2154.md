**Progression:**
3 vs 3 on 28x20. Defensive pressing; two jokers are positioned opposite each other outside the sideline at the center (yellow and red). A pass to the yellow joker allows the team in possession to have 2 touches and attack both goals. A pass to the red joker requires the team in possession to play with their weaker foot and allows them to attack both goals with an unlimited number of touches. After the attack is finished, jokers return to their initial positions. Defense must play pressing.

**Variations:**
Each player must touch the ball while it is in their possession in order to qualify for collaboration with the joker.
