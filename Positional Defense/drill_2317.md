# Drill 2317

**Short description:**
Fonte: video webinar Juanlu 40:16 a 45:00

**Objectives:**
Stimulate the defensive leap

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
3vs3 + goalkeepers. There are 2 external players positioned in the first 6/8 meters. If a player makes a pass to the external player, the external player enters the field. However, if the external player returns the ball to the one who passed it, the external player stays off the field. This is designed so that when the defender makes the defensive leap, they will need to block the horizontal return pass. If the ball is passed to one of the other two players, then the one who made the pass exits the field.

**Variations:**
Same exercise but we divide the field in half vertically (imaginary line).. we move the wings up to 10 meters.. I can only play the ball on the outside of the side where I am.. if I am on the left half.. I only play on the left, etc.. in this way, we train "short" passes.
