# Drill 318

**Short description:**
Individual defense with changes in the midfield.

**Objectives:**
Individual defense with changes in the middle of the field. (Switching marks, player on the opposite side of the ball, coverages)

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**
series of 4 minutes (depending on the players we have)

**Number of players:**
6 players + 2 goalkeepers

**Materials:**
Balls, bibs, cones.

**Progression:**
A 3x3 game situation with 2 goalkeepers is developed (there are no throw-ins or corner kicks). When a team recovers the ball (if it's on the opposing side of the field, the game continues / if it's on their own side, the game starts with the possession of the team that recovered the ball). If a goal is scored, the team continues with ball possession. If the ball goes out, play always resumes with a positional attack.

**Variations:**
Limit the number of touches. Whenever the ball is recovered, the game should continue.
