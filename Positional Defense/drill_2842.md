**Progression:**
There is a pair of players who always work in defense, with the coach in the middle serving as a reference for the pair in attack, and at the beginning of the action receives the first pass to choose the pair that will attack. This pair will have to attempt a shot on goal. In a reduced space, the attitudes of the two players in defense will always be related to a first line of pressure, pressing the ball and on the opposite side covering appropriately, intercepting the pass in the middle and depending on the pressure, managing to advance as much as possible on their reference opponent.
