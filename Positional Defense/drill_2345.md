**Progression:**
It starts with a 2vs2 in one half of the field, the other 2 players cannot enter. If the defenders steal the ball, they can finish. If the attackers cross the midfield line, it becomes a 3vs2 attack (so only 1 defender from the first line can return). When the ball goes out, it always starts from the goalkeeper.

**Variations:**
The defender who was bypassed must touch the hand of a teammate and then can fall back.
