**Short description:**
PERFORMANCE LAB NITTI 01:24:00

**Objectives:**
Defense of screens, switching, play with the pivot, individual defense after a through pass

**Area (mxm):**
28x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
3v3 with 3 touches. There are 2 side players, one of my color, one of the opposite color. If I pass the ball to the side player of the opposite color, it can only be done in the offensive half, and they will act as a pivot, and the defense will have to be man-to-man after the breakthrough. If I pass the ball to the side player of the same color as mine in the defensive half, we switch roles, and they come on the field while I go off. If I pass the ball to the side player of the same color as mine in the offensive half, we still switch roles, but we will also change the direction of the attack (to practice retreating).
