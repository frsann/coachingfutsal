# Drill 2816

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Dual purpose, depending on how it is used: changing references and thus both offensive and defensive adjustments; defense against the moving goalkeeper.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
12

**Number of players:**
12 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, there is a 4vs4 with two jokers for each team, and when the ball is passed to a joker, the ball is put back into play by the joker on the other side. The objective naturally becomes that of changing references, with possible adaptations in both phases, and with movements that always fall within the dynamism of the offensive game.

**Variations:**
In the event that the defense is forced to be active only on half of the field, releasing the wildcard player by allowing them more touches on the ball and movement along the sideline within the allowed space, developments similar to those seen in an attack with a flying goalkeeper would occur. In this scenario, the attackers are staggered by position, resulting in a defense opposing a more static but more functional gameplay for training in a special situation, such as that of a flying goalkeeper.
