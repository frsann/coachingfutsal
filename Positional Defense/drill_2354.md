**Progression:**
Players are divided into 3 teams; the game allows two touches; the playing area can be adjusted depending on the objectives you want to achieve and the phase you want to facilitate. Players develop a 3vs1 rondo, where only one defender can intercept, press, and attack the ball. On the other side, a trio waits in the predetermined space. Between the two teams, one waiting and the other developing the rondo, there are two additional defenders. If the goal of the team with the ball in the rondo is to pass the ball to the team waiting on the other side, without a required number of passes, the goal of the other two defenders is to prevent this pass from happening. Otherwise, the last defender will enter the new rondo that forms, and the other two will remain intercepting the ball. If the ball is intercepted, the trio that loses it will assume the defense, and the game restarts on the opposite side.
