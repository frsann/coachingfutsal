**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educational Unit: Basics of Defense. Contents: space control, fluctuation, sliding, timing, visual field control and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive fakes, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a realistic 40x20 match, always defending in a 3v4 disadvantage. The defensive team, despite being one man down, must press to prevent the ball from approaching their goal. The attackers cannot pass to the opposing half of the field before making at least 2 passes. (If we want, we can prohibit passing to the offensive side with high passes.) Once the attackers move to the offensive side, the defender can either press in defense or play a special 3v4 defense. When a role change occurs, a player from the team losing possession must exit, and a player from the team gaining possession enters from their side of the field. Ask the player to: press the ball. Read the game's orientation and the defensive orientation while pressing. Space control. Utilize basic elements such as stalling and floating. Master the space of game progression settings.

**Variations:**
Solo goal on the first try
