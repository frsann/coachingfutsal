# Drill 3095

**Short description:**
The Futsal Way

**Objectives:**
Improve the relationship dynamics in a switch defense. Adding asymmetry afterwards can activate other mechanisms typical of a zonal defense, to be used in special situations or constantly in a switch defense, against other game systems that lead to numerical superiority/inferiority in certain areas of the field.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
7 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Didactically, you start with a 3v3 in 20 meters, almost always making the change in the front line mandatory. We do this for 1 minute. Outside there's a fourth player who will join at the end of this minute, and their entry and team will be determined by the coach. The fourth player will play for 30 seconds first in one team, then switch to the opposing team. If in the first 30 seconds the team with 3 players regains possession of the ball, the fourth player will directly switch to them.

**Variations:**


**Categories:**
Positional Defense, Positional Defense - Pressing
