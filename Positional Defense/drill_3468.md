3vs3 on a small field, defense training for switches. There are 6 players at the corners, 3 per team. Every minute all three-player groups switch on the fly regardless of what is happening. The ball is put back into play by the coach or the third goalkeeper who stands at midfield. The aim is to seek a quick transition while the opponents have not yet positioned themselves. If possible, use the scoreboard with the time so that players can try to "play with the clock."
