# Drill 2296

**Short description:**
Musti to train defense of changes

**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
20

**Number of players:**
12 + 1P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
4vs4 + 2 external players positioned at 10 meters. When a player with the ball exits the field laterally, another player with the ball enters from the opposite side and the defense must readjust, with the opposite wing rising to the ball, and the entire defense must readjust (change defenders every 4 minutes). Encourage those entering not to necessarily look for a quick conclusion but to simply attract the defense and then seek the side change.

**Variations:**
- the exact same exercise but we have the player enter from the same side, in this case, we will train the strong side coverage.
