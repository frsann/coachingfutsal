**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Players are divided into 3 teams; the game is two-touch; the playing area is adjustable based on the goals you want to achieve and the phase you want to facilitate. The players develop a 3vs1 rondo, with only one defender who can intercept, press, or attack the ball. On the other side, there's a trio waiting in another predetermined space. Between the two teams, one waiting and the other developing the rondo, there are two more defenders. If the team in possession in the rondo aims to pass the ball to the team waiting on the other side, without a set number of required passes, the objective of the other two defenders is to prevent this pass. If the pass occurs, the last defender will enter the new forming rondo while the other two remain intercepting the ball. If the ball is intercepted, the trio that loses it will set up in defense, and the game will restart from the opposite side.
