# Drill 2300

**Short description:**
Full-court press defense

**Objectives:**
Improve defensive fundamentals by starting from situations of numerical disadvantage, trying to cut off an attacker by closing the passing lanes to him while pressing the player with the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + 2P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Educational Unit: Basics of Defense. Content: space control, fluctuation, slipping, timing, visual field control and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a realistic 40x20 match, always playing defense in a 3v4 disadvantage. The defensive team, even with one less player, must press to prevent the ball from approaching their goal. The attackers cannot pass into the opposing half before making at least 2 passes. (If we want, we can ban passing to the offensive side with high passes.) After the attackers move to the offensive side, the defender can press in defense or play special 3v4 defense. When a role change occurs, a player from the team losing possession must exit, and a player from the team gaining possession enters from their side of the field. Ask the player: press the ball. Read the game orientation and defensive orientation while pressing. Control the space. Use basic elements like delaying and floating. Master the space in game progression settings.

**Variations:**
First-time solo goal
