**Objectives:**


**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**


**Number of players:**
8 + P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
Three-phase chaining exercise to coordinate defense lines. Phase 1 in a 3x2 starting from the pivot's support. Phase 2 in a 3x3 when the ball passes through the first line of cones. Phase 3 in a 4x4 + Goalkeeper when the ball passes through the second line of cones. Once the defense recovers the ball, it continues in a 5x5.

**Variations:**
- If we cannot play full-court 5v5, set a "target" to reach when pressing out. If we can do it, of course, we will have a goalkeeper on the other side.
