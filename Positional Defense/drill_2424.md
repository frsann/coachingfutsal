**Short description:**
One wants to train a situation with the central objective of a 1vs1, but which contains the completeness that the Game should eventually have.

**Objectives:**
Improve 1vs1 skills and train the concept that if my man cuts in, I continue to mark him without turning around.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**
15'

**Number of players:**
8 or more, if they are even 2 pivots, if they are odd 1 pivot

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
The action begins with a deconstructed attack play where the player who passes the ball cuts in a curl towards the center, leaving the ball to their teammate, who will have another ball in hand and then defends a lateral 1vs1. The attacking player will have another ball in hand and a pivot who frees up to receive the ball, which is an option to pass with the feet. If they choose this option, they will then lead the 1vs1 with the ball they have in their hands, as the pivot will finish the received pass. Otherwise, they will continue the 1vs1 with their own ball. There are 2 goalkeepers, one defending the potential finish by the pivot and the other defending the possible conclusion of the 1vs1.

**Variations:**
Before starting 1vs1, different types of movements can be used, such as parallel, wall, etc.
