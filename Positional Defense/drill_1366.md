# Drill 1366

**Short description:**
4v3 Work on marking replacements

**Objectives:**
Improving defensive foundations starting from situations of numerical disadvantage by attempting to cut off an attacker by closing passing lines to him while pressing the player with the ball.

**Area (mxm):**
40x20

**Duration (min):**
10-15

**Number of players:**
10 + mistakes

**Materials:**
Balls, printed t-shirts

**Progression:**
Educational Unit: Defense Basics. Stage: After Technification. Content: Space control, floating, retreat, delay (timing) control of field of vision and peripheral vision, defensive mobility, defensive feints, reading defensive orientation, etc. We play a real game on a 40x20 field, always playing defense at a disadvantage 3v4. The defensive team, although at a disadvantage, must play pressing to prevent the progress of the game towards our goal. Attackers cannot cross into the attacking half until they make at least 2 passes. (If we want, we can prohibit crossing to the attacking side with high passes) After the attackers cross to the attacking side, defenders can play defense through pressing or play special defense 3v4. When a role change occurs, one player from the team that loses possession must exit, and one player from the team that gains possession enters from their side of the field. Demand from players: Pressure on the ball. Reading defensive orientation and defensive orientation in pressing. Space control. Use basics such as delay and floating. Spatial mastery of game progression settings.

**Variations:**
The first goal counts.
