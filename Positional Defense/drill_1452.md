**Progression:**
A real 4v4 game on a 20x20m field in one direction. The goal must be scored with a first-time shot within 6m. We always work on one half of the field and attack 2 goals located on the goal line but within the 6m area. When there is a change of possession or the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper located in the corner plays a new ball for the team that gained possession. At that moment, we switch from defense to attack. Change goalkeepers every 5 attacks.

**Variations:**
If a goal is scored, the reward is in the form of a new attack. A goal can also be scored from beyond 6m. We can also introduce penalties for the team that loses.
