# Drill 2624

**Short description:**
"We want to train a situation with the central objective of a 1vs1, but that also incorporates the completeness that the game should eventually have. Link The Futsal Way - Marcio Coelho"

**Objectives:**
Improve 1v1 skills and train the concept that if my man cuts in, I continue to mark him without turning around.

**Area (mxm):**
30x20

**Duration (min):**
15

**Number of players:**
8 + 1 PIVOT + 1 P

**Materials:**


**Progression:**
It starts with a deconstructed offensive play where the player who passes the ball curls towards the center and leaves the ball to their teammate, who will have another ball in hand, and then defends a lateral 1vs1. The attacking player will have another ball in hand and a pivot who frees themselves to receive the ball between their feet as an option. If they choose this option, they will then conduct the 1vs1 with the ball they have in their hands since the pivot will complete the received pass. Otherwise, they will continue the 1vs1 with their own ball. There should be two goalkeepers: one defending against the possible pivot finish, and the other defending against the possible outcome of the 1vs1. If there's only one, you "make do."

**Variations:**
Before starting the 1vs1, different types of movement can be used, such as parallel, wall, curtain, etc.
