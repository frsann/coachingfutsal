**Progression:**
The game is played 3X3 on a 28X20. The defense is mandatorily in pressure with the rule that, in the offensive half, there can be a maximum of two defenders. The intention is to force the defense to quickly organize the first line and defend 3 players with it. Variation in the behavior of the 1st line depending on the opponents' movements and pressure on the ball, retreat of the first line if I lose defensive height.
