# Drill 2615

**Short description:**
20x20. 1v1 starts from the corner. The attacker goes into defense.

**Objectives:**
1v1.

**Area (mxm):**
20x20

**Duration (min):**
10-12

**Number of players:**
All players

**Materials:**
Balls, markers.

**Progression:**
We use half the field with 2 goalkeepers. Players are divided into two equal groups and placed in a line in the corner of the field, diagonally opposite each other. The player at the front of the line has the ball. The exercise begins with 1 defender in the middle. An attacker from one line goes 1v1 and tries to score a goal. As soon as the attack ends, the attacker becomes the defender and the player at the front of the line goes 1v1 and tries to score in the other goal. If the attacker loses possession, they must make one press before defending. Key Points (Coaching Points): Speed in dribbling. Accelerate to the goal and try to go 1v1 against the goalkeeper. Immediate transition attack/defense.

**Variations:**
Change the starting position of the attacker, for example to the middle of the field to create a 1vGK with the defensive recovery.
